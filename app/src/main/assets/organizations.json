If a particular horse interests them, they should put that horse's name on the application. An USERL volunteer will contact them to discuss the horse and put them in contact with the foster home. Once the potential adopter, foster home and the appropriate USERL Regional Director and\/or Executive Director agree that the horse and adopter is a match, USERL will schedule a barn check.  An USERL volunteer will schedule a time to meet you at your barn. S\/he will be looking for safety (i.e. no barbed wire, no junk in the pastures), a clean, healthy environment and the condition and temperament of your other horses, if any.  Depending on how quickly you can get out to meet the equine and how quickly we can get a volunteer to do your barn check, typically the process takes one week to one month.\r\nComplete and return the USERL Preliminary Adoption Application.  We will then contact you directly if we have additional questions. \r\nIf the personal interview is satisfactory and if the USERL has a potentially suitable equine at the time, the USERL will schedule an appointment to check the potential adopter's facilities. In addition, the USERL will also conduct interviews of the references provided by the potential adopter on the Preliminary Adoption Application. \r\nUpon satisfactory completion of the above, USERL will schedule a working session with the potential equine to determine if this is a suitable match. \r\nUpon the completion of the session, it will be determined whether or not the equine and potential adopter are compatible.

This will help the adoption counselors facilitate the matchmaking process.  Most adoptions take at least 45 minutes to one hour to complete.  The Adoption Center is a busy place, so please be patient and allow yourself enough time for our process.  THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nWhat we will need to know when you adopt a new companion:\r\n\r\nIf you own your home, please bring some item of verification (tax bill, water bill, or mortgage statement.)  Please also be sure to check your homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.  Some policies restrict coverage for certain dog breeds.\r\n\r\nIf you DO NOT own your place of residence, please be sure the property owner will consent to have a pet on his\/her property.  We will verify with landlords over the phone before sending a new companion home, so please have the appropriate name and phone number available.\r\n\r\nOther pets already living with you will need to be up-to-date on vaccination.  This is to decrease the risk of spreading infectious disease from one animal to another.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that your new companion will be a member of your family.  This can mean a \r\n10-15 year commitment from you!  Please bring along family members so we can make sure it will be a good match before you make a commitment.  Also, if adopting a second dog, please bring your current dog with you---we can let them spend some time together and give you some suggestions on surviving the adjustment period.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure you have considered the financial obligation involved in caring for a companion animal.  This includes routine veterinary and emergency care, in addition to food, supplies and training.  The adoption counselors can give you an idea of basic costs involved for each type of animal.\r\n\r\nMany animals adopted from shelters can require an immediate visit to the veterinarian.  Because of the volume of un-vaccinated animals entering a shelter\u2019s care, the risk of transmissible contagious diseases can be quite high.  Kennel cough in dogs, and upper respiratory infections in cats are the two most common diseases that your newly adopted companion may experience.  You must ask yourself if you have the financial means to care for your new friend, beyond the initial adoption costs.\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU COMMIT!!!!!  Please be honest with yourself about the actual time you have to train, groom, and exercise the companion animal you have chosen.  Some things to consider: Do you work long or erratic hours?  Do you like outdoor activity?  Who will care for your pet while you travel?  Will your pet be the appropriate size when he or she is full grown?  When adopting into a home with children:  Are you adopting to teach your child responsibility, or are your adopting because you have a responsible child?  Are your children comfortable around the animal you\u2019ve chosen?  Will YOU still remain committed to this animal when the children lose interest?  Take the time now to consider these things and find the best match for your lifestyle!\r\n\r\nWe thank your for offering your home to a \u201cpre-loved\u201d companion.  We hope he or she will be a wonderful addition to your family and your home!\r\n","about":"The Thomas J. O'Connor Animal Control and Adoption Center provides comprehensive animal control services and programs to our communities for the protection of animals, public health and safety, and the environment. \r\n\r\nThe Thomas J.

Our center has a full-service adoption service, a service rarely offered through municipal animal control programs. TJO has an in-house veterinarian two days per week, responsible for shelter animal wellness and sterilization surgery. Adoptable animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated and screened for other health concerns.  Each animal is then placed into the adoption area to await a new home.

This can range between $50 and $200, but varies from pet to pet. It includes, but is not limited to the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***Basic vaccinations: Adult 8 in 1 Booster for dogs that come in at 6 months of age or older. Age appropriate puppy shots while in our care.,\r\n\r\n***De-worming of your new dog or puppies (this is given several times) \r\n\r\n***Heartworm test if the dog is of age. \r\n\r\n***Frontline or Adams for flea and tick treatment and prevention. \r\n\r\n***Heart guard for Heart worm prevention during the entire time the animal is at our facility. (age appropriate) \r\n\r\n***Spaying or Neutering of the dog if the puppy\/dog is old enough to be altered before leaving (over 6 months). Every animal we adopt out MUST be altered and you must sign a contract to this effect.\r\n\r\n***State required rabies vaccination administered by our veterinarian. (Age appropriate)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of times our adoption fees do not even begin to cover what we put into the care and vet work of each animal. We are a privately run rescue and do everything out of pocket. This includes food, medical and basic day to day care of these animals. Thanks for wanting to save a life!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of State Adoptions and Shipping Info\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you are out of state and have found a puppy or dog you know you would love to bring home. We use Delta Pets First to fly our new puppies home. Sometimes when no Delta Flights are available, we fly American. We do all the flight scheduling and make all arrangements. We ask that you give us the times\/days you can generally pick up on and a list of local airport. Weekends are hard to book, but can be possible. We do not drug our puppies for the trip and have never had a problem with one of them not arriving safely. (although sometimes they do arrive a little messy) We recommend bringing a towel with you when you pick them up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTravel Expenses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe charge 50.00 for taking your new pet to the airport, and for the time we spend buying the crate, bedding, food and water dish, and preparing your pet for travel. We also have to take your dog or cat to the veterinarian for an additional vet check, to get a health certificate, which is required by all airlines. Each of us are volunteers and we charge this additional fee to help recoup some of our expenses for gas and travel time (the airport is about one hour each way) and we generally spend an hour on each puppy\/dog going out there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrate for Shipping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour new puppy\/dog will need an airline safe crate for travel. The cost of the crate depends on what size he\/she requires. \r\n\r\nSmall Crate - $45 \r\n\r\nMedium Crate - $65 \r\n\r\nLarge Crate - $85 \r\n\r\nWe line the bottom of the crate with blankets or towels for comfort and in case there is an accident and we provide a safe toy for the trip to make it easier (unless two puppies are flying together). This crate is yours to keep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Certificate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour new friend will require a Health Certificate for travel. He\/she will be taken to our Vet and given an exam. He generally checks the dog\/puppy over and looks at eyes, ears, and hips. He listens to their heart and lungs. This is just part of the exam. The cost for this is $50. You will receive the health certificate with your new puppy\/dog and it will have the vet's info who completed the exam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping Costs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for the cost of shipping. You pay for this when you pick them up at the airport (Usually around $175 depending for most puppies\/small dogs). However, if your new baby must fly American, the cost of the flight must be paid up front. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayment Information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee, health certificate, crate costs and travel expenses are due before the puppy is sent home. We accept Paypal or you can send a money order via USPS, UPS or Fed Ex. Please contact us if you have any questions.\r\n ","about":"Rescue Volunteer Adoptions is a group of volunteer dog lovers whose mission is to rescue, provide sanctuary, and ultimately to re-home abandoned, stray and neglected dogs.

Adopting a pet represents a commitment to care for the animal for potentially many years. Adopters are encouraged to spend as much time as possible with the animal to ensure that the animal is the best match for their home and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nSteps in the Adoption Process\r\n1. If you are adopting a dog, you will first complete a Meet Your Match survey and get a color card. This color will correspond to the color cards on the dog kennels to help find your best match.\r\n\r\n2. Visit with the animals. An adoption counselor will assist you in making your selection.\r\n\r\n3. Submit an adoption application. The application will be reviewed within 24-72 hours and you will be notified if any additional information is needed. Animals generally do not go home the same day that an application is submitted.\r\n\r\n4. Finalize your adoption contract. This may take place at the same time as you submit your application.\r\n\r\n5. Pick up your new pet! This would happen at the Shelter if your pet is already spayed\/neutered. If not, you would pick him\/her up from the veterinarian\u2019s office after surgery.\r\n\r\nRemember that even though we take the best possible care of animals at our shelter, we do not always know their prior medical history or vaccination status. We perform basic health checkups, but do not have veterinarians on staff. It is very important to take advantage of the free health checkup offered by our participating veterinarians as soon as possible after adoption. The office visit is free, but the veterinarian may recommend vaccinations and other care that you may wish to consider.\r\n\r\nAdoption Fees\r\nDogs\r\n\r\nMale: $70.00\r\nNeutered male: $30.00\r\nFemale: $75.00\r\nSpayed female: $30.00\r\n\r\nCats\r\n\r\nMale: $50.00\r\nNeutered male: $10.00\r\nFemale: $60.00\r\nSpayed female: $10.00\r\n\r\nRabbits: $5.00\r\n\r\nOther Animals: Varies\r\n","about":"We are a county owned facility providing all animal control and sheltering services in Loudoun County, VA.","meetPets":"At the shelter during business hours: Mon, Tue, Thu, and Fri 1-6pm; Wed 1-8pm; Sat 11am-5pm.

As one of the first humane societies in the United States, our original purpose was to prevent cruelty and provide refuge for both animals and children. To this day, we investigate cruelty to animals and provide homeless, abused and abandoned animals with protection and safety. TAHS is a private, non-profit organization and receives no funding from the United Way, the government, or national humane organizations. Donations from local individuals, corporations and generated by our fundraisers are the sole source of funding. Programs like Forever Friends, for people who include TAHS in their wills, and the Golden Paw League, for people who give gifts of $100 or more, have been established to give people donation options and to recognize their generosity. Volunteers help supplement the staff assisting with tasks both inside and outside of our facility. Volunteers provide enrichment for animals such as walking dogs or socializing cats. The Humane Education and Pet Therapy Visitation programs are dependent on our volunteers. Foster care volunteers provide a safe, nurturing environment for animals too young for adoption and for sick or injured animals. It is our goal to help every animal at-risk for abandonment or cruelty, and to find a home for every adoptable animal. The Humane Society is the only animal welfare group in this community who will give refuge to any animal at-risk for abuse or neglect, regardless of its type, health, age or whether we have space. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"The Toledo Area Humane Society offers adoptions at our main office at 1920 Indianwood Circle in Maumee as well as one of our several off site locations.

Our satisfaction comes from knowing we have helped an orphaned Doberman find its forever home. If you are in a hurry to adopt a Doberman, LOMDR is not an organization you will have a successful experience with. It is in everyone\u2019s best interest to be thorough and thoughtful throughout every step of our application process. \r\n\r\nSTEP 1 Complete the application and return to LOMDR. You may choose to submit your application by way of regular mail, email, or fax. Mailing address, e-mail and fax are listed on the top portion of the application. Please note that during the application process you may be working with several different volunteers. \r\n\r\nSTEP2 Once your application is received, a volunteer will contact you. Please be patient, as all members are volunteers, it may take up to a week to be contacted. The volunteer will discuss what you are looking for or about the specific dog you are inquiring about to determine a good fit. \r\n\r\nSTEP 3 Veterinarian checks and reference checks will be conducted. It is absolutely mandatory that your past and current animals are up to date on vaccinations and are also spayed\/neutered. Current pets must also be maintained on heartworm preventative. LOMDR strives to help control the pet population and will not adopt to homes with animals not spayed\/neutered unless there is a medical reason or you are showing your dog in the ring. \r\n\r\nSTEP 4 While we are in the process of completing your application, a volunteer will contact you to schedule an interview and home visit. The purpose of this visit is to ensure a safe environment for the dog and to verify the information you have listed on your application. The interview helps ensure the adopting family understands the responsibilities of owning and caring for a Doberman. LOMDR may also take this time to allow you to have a visit with the dog (if available) to see how the family interacts. The adoption process WILL NOT be completed until an interview and home visit is complete. \r\n\r\nSTEP 5 We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if, in our judgment, the home situation is not compatible with the needs of a Doberman or if the breed is not suitable for the applicant. To complete a valid adoption, an adoption contract must be signed and an adoption donation collected. The adoption donation serves to reimburse Lean On Me Doberman Rescue for the medical costs invested in your new pet. All adoption donations should be made payable to Lean On Me Doberman Rescue. \r\n\r\nBecause LOMDR is a non-for-profit group, this fee simply is deposited into a pool of funds to help the next Doberman Pinscher in need of our assistance. \r\n\r\nAdoption Donations are:  Puppies (7 months and under) $300.00: Adults $250.00 ","about":"Lean On Me Doberman Rescue is licensed by the Illinois Department of Agriculture as an approved animal shelter. We are a 501c3, Not for Profit Organization and a corporation in the State of Illinois composed solely of volunteers. Our purpose is to educate the public about rescue, to promote responsible dog ownership, and to reduce the abuse and neglect of Doberman Pinscher dogs. In addition, our mission is to provide educational services about training, altering, and the humane care of dogs and to also promote good canine citizenship. LOMDR is dedicated to saving abused, abandoned, surrendered, and homeless Dobermans. Our goal is to restore to good health, rehabilitate, and place them into safe and loving permanent homes.

Our organization's volunteers ensure that pets are treated in a humane manner.  We provide foster homes for rescued animals and we find permanent \"forever\" homes for pets.  Our goal is to have an animal shelter in Baker City, Oregon that will help us provide the best service possible to our pets and to families.  We are currently raising funds for this facility.\r\n\r\nHistory \r\nOur group was born in 1988 when two people rescued a pregnant and abused mutt from a group of drug-using people. She came to be known as Lucky. Lucky received a complete makeover, was housebroken, went to charm school and after acquiring acceptable social graces, she was placed in a loving home with children until the end of her days. \r\n\r\nShortly after this rescue, a small group of people gathered to try to duplicate Lucky's good fortune. In 1989, the process of requesting a non-profit status from the federal government began. After almost a year of correspondence, our non-profit status was granted in 1990 and continues today. \r\n\r\nThe original group of 20 worked diligently and in its best years touched over 300 dogs and 300 cats in one way or another (shots, worming, spay\/neuter, finding homes, reuniting with owners, etc.). After 6 years the small group dwindled down to a handful of volunteers. Those volunteers, although committed to their work, became worn out. The group became inactive. \r\n\r\nBest Friends of Baker, Inc. found new friends in 2005 who wished to refresh and revive the original intent of helping pets which will reflect more long-term goals and ultimately establishing a permanent shelter in Baker City.","meetPets":"Online: http:\/\/www.bestfriendsofbaker.org, http:\/\/www.petfinder.com\/shelters\/OR148.html","services":"Foster homes, Adoption services, Animal advocates, Resource for any pet question","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

If you purchase heartworm prevention and\/or flea\/tick products through an online pharmacy like www.petcarerx.com we will need copies of your purchase history which can be obtained from the online pharmacy.\r\n\r\n    * All applicants must be 21 years of age and living on your own. If you are under 21 and living at home with your parents, please have them fill out the adoption application for you.\r\n\r\n    * If you have children under the age of ten, certain criteria will need to be met before a boxer is placed in your home. LBR will be happy to discuss this with each family as the need arises.\r\n\r\n    * All domesticated animals (with the exception of feral cats) must be kept as indoor residents of your home. We do not place our boxers in homes with or as outdoor companion animals.\r\n\r\n    * We will not place two female dogs in the same home. With the dominance issues commonly seen in females, we feel we can increase the odds for a successful adoption by not placing females in the same home together.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE WE'VE RECEIVED YOUR APPLICATION...\r\nOnce we have received your completed application, here is a list of what you can expect. We realize that this seems like a lot, and it may even seem invasive to some, but we want you to adopt a boxer if you meet the criteria described herein, so please bear with us. Most, if not all, of our volunteers work full time and have families of their own to care for, and we do our best to ensure that all applications are processed in a timely fashion but we do ask that you please have patience.\r\n\r\n    * An LBR volunteer will check the personal and veterinary references listed on your application. Since most vets require their clients permission to release any records, please contact your vet so that we are able to complete the vet check for your application. Once the personal and veterinary references are checked, and deemed acceptable, an LBR volunteer will contact you to schedule a home visit. We conduct the home visit to ensure that our boxers have a safe and loving environment to call home.\r\n\r\n    * On the application, you are asked to list any boxers that you have seen on LBR\u2019s website that you may be interested in adopting. But please be aware that often times we have more than one applicant interested in the same boxer. In that case, the home best suited for the boxer will be chosen for placement. LBR does not do adoptions on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, and in many cases we may make a recommendation depending on your circumstances.\r\n\r\n    * After finding a boxer that you and LBR are in agreement would be a good match for you, we ask that you make arrangements to meet the boxer. Generally, this involves attending one of our Meet Our Boxer events, or we may ask the foster family to contact you directly. When you visit a boxer, we ask that all family members be present, as well as any current pets if possible.\r\n\r\n    * In some cases, we may feel that a particular boxer is not a good match for you and your family, please do not be offended by this. LBR does not take the placement of a boxer lightly, and we strive to do our best to ensure that each placement is forever, as many of these wonderful boxers have led very unstable lives before coming into rescue and we only want what is best for them. We will be happy to disclose our reasons for the decisions that we make in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN MY APPLICATION IS APPROVED?\r\nOnce your application has been approved and you have found the boxer of your dreams, there are only a few items remaining in this process.\r\n\r\n    * Our adoption donation\u2019s range from $125.00 to $300.00 depending on the dog being adopted. This determination is based on many factors, to include, but not limited to the dog\u2019s age and any past adoption history with LBR. Our boxers are examined for any health issues, spayed\/neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, and are protected from heartworms, fleas and ticks while in foster care. LBR uses Revolution, an all-inclusive topical agent for heartworm, flea and tick prevention, or Heartgard HW Prevention and Frontline Flea\/Tick Prevention. While in foster care, LBR volunteers work with the boxers on basic obedience commands, but we cannot guarantee that every dog will learn basic obedience commands while in foster care. LBR always recommends that the new owners find a training center that utilizes only positive training techniques for their new family member to help him or her be the best possible companion animal for you and your family.\r\n\r\n    * Upon adoption LBR will have you sign a legally binding adoption agreement. If there ever comes a time when you wish to give up your boxer he\/she MUST be returned to LBR as stated in the adoption agreement. Adopter also agrees that the provided Legacy Boxer Rescue tag will remain on the boxer at all times, and LBR must be notified if the boxer is ever lost or stolen, we have many resources in the area that could help in locating your boxer should such an event ever take place.\r\n\r\n    * Be prepared for the arrival of your new boxer, please click here for a list of items that LBR recommends that you have on hand when he\/she comes home.\r\n\r\n","about":"For every life there is a legacy. In many instances the legacy passed down is not as it should be and requires help from caring souls to be fulfilled. It is our belief that all Boxers should have a legacy befitting of their wonderful enthusiasm and love of life, but sadly, this isn't always the case.\r\n\r\nWe, the founder and volunteers of Legacy Boxer Rescue, have made it our mission to seek out these Boxers and create a legacy they deserve, a loving family and home of their own.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that a Boxer's future should never be uncertain, so we will help to create better, happier legacies for them; one Boxer at a time.\r\n\r\nA legacy that replaces despair with hope, sorrow with happiness, fear with security, and pain with love.","meetPets":"http:\/\/savetheboxers.com\/calendar.php","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

There is no limitation on the area that we will serve so long as we can do the appropriate reference checking, perform the home review\/approval process (with the help of rescue friends in those areas), and then work out transport arrangements with the adoptive families.  We also will be assisting other organizations\/shelters and help facilitate adoptions from those facilities to the extent that transport to our area can be arranged.    ","adoptionProcess":"The adoption process will begin with an extensive adoption application, accessible on our website.  In addition to a series of questions (e.g., to ascertain the adopter's likes\/dislikes, lifestyle, and general suitability), the application will require, among other things,  a veterinary reference and two personal (non-family member) references.  In lieu of a veterinary references, we will require 3 personal references.  We will also require submission of digital photos of home and yard, as well as a home visit.  Approved adopters will be required to take their pup or dog to the vet within 7 days of adoption.  Each animal adopted from Safe At Last will go home with a medical booklet, complete with all details of vetting done prior to adoption, with explicit instructions as to the follow up required.  All animals will be UTD with all age appropriate shots prior to adoption, and barring any health reasons that would preclude it, they will be placed on topical protection for fleas\/ticks, and based on age, also started on heartworm preventative (or provided with the first dose).  Any animals older than 4 months will be spayed\/neutered before adoptions.  For animals under 4 months old, the adoption contract will require spay\/neuter by the time the animal is 6 months of age.  We will require proof of same and will assign one of our members to have the task of following up on proof of spay and neuter.  Under the contract, the adoptive family will not \"own\" the animal until we have received proof of spay and neuter.  Failure to have the surgery performed will allow us, under the contract, to reclaim the pet.","about":"Safe At Last Animal Rescue is an all-volunteer not-for-profit group dedicated to saving the lives of shelter animals.  Every day, staggering numbers of wonderful animals are discarded in shelters across the country.  Irresponsible pet ownership -- be it, the failure to spay\/neuter or follow through on one's commitment  -- results in a tragic loss of life. We, at Safe At Last, feel these animals need a voice.  \r\n\r\nIt is Safe At Last's mission to help ease the suffering, as well as stop it at its source.  We do this by taking animals into our organization from shelters across the country, fostering them in our homes, providing them proper veterinary care, and then matching them with wonderful forever homes.  \r\n\r\nFurther, to help assist with the financial plight in many of the shelters, we send the bulk of our adoptions fees back to the shelters.  We also do fundraisers to raise much needed monies for the shelters, many of which are barely able to keep their doors open.  These funds assist the shelters in buying the basics (food & medicines) for the continuing influx of animals.  These monies also allow the shelters to provide more advanced medical care (e.g., heartworm treatment, special surgeries), thus increasing the likelihood that these animals will be able to get to rescue. \r\n\r\nSafe At Last is also working directly with shelters to assist in facilitating adoptions directly from those facilities.  This not only gets more animals out of the shelters and into forever homes, but also provides much-needed financial support.  \r\n\r\nFinally, Safe At Last is dedicated to education (both online and event-related).  Educational efforts are multi-dimensional.  We educate relative to stopping the overpopulation problem  at its source, by emphasizing the need to spay and neuter.  We also educate to increase awareness regarding animals already in need, stressing adoption via rescue rather than pet shops or breeders.  Finally, we educate regarding responsible pet ownership and general \"pet-related\" matters. \r\n\r\nAt Safe at Last, we remain committed to saving shelter pets, one life at a time.

Mike was well-known in the Florida Panhandle for his extensive work with the Pensacola Humane Society and other animal rescue organizations.

We joined Mike as volunteers in late 2007, and eventually assumed the day-to-day rescue operations as his health declined. Although Mike passed away in May, 2009, we have devoted ourselves to continuing his mission to rescue greyhounds and other pets. Escarosa Greyhound and All-Pet Adoptions is a shelter dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of greyhounds, other dog breeds (including mixed-breeds), cats, and assorted small pets as space allows. \r\nOur organization is run entirely by volunteers, and is funded strictly by donations and small fund-raisers.

We rescue Cattle Dogs from shelters in Northern California and also help owners rehome their dogs.

Jennifer noticed that Cattle Dogs fare particularly poorly in shelters due to the stress of being isolated from people, confined in close proximity to other dogs of varying temperments, and the lack of exercise opportunities available in a shelter environment. When stressed, they often shut down and seem unfriendly and unadoptable, so their euthenasia rate in shelters is very high.  Cattledog Dreams was founded to help prevent this trangic loss of life for a breed that wants nothing more than to be with people.  ","meetPets":"By appointment only.

We are a growing rescue and as such, we are always learning and refining. Sometimes situations arise that we have not encountered and our policy in those situations is to look at the issue on a case by case basis and have a Board of Directors vote. Votes can sometimes take a couple days. The spirit of our policies is to ensure the \"forever\" part of \"forever home\" to the best of everyone's ability. We stand behind our dogs and want what is best for everyone involved.\r\n\r\n    * We cannot do \"one day\" adoptions. Due to the detailed nature of our process, it usually takes between two weeks and a month to get your dog home to you. The approval process takes around 5 days depending on many factors. We even require our foster parents and Board Members to submit an application with references to have on file in the event that they decide to adopt so that we have complete paperwork on file for every adoption.\r\n    * We keep applications on file and active for 6 months. After 6 months, we happily reactivate applications, but have to touch base to identify changes in the home (new pets, new vet, etc).\r\n    * Applications are good for dogs in our program in general and not tied to particular dogs. If you do not see a dog on our website that you connect with, we encourage you to put in an application anyway - we get new dogs regularly.\r\n    * Adopters must be at least 18 years of age.\r\n    * All adults in the home must agree on the adoption of a collie.\r\n    * An adoption application must be completed and a non-refundable application fee of $10 paid to the rescue. If the prospective adopter adopts, then this application fee will be credited to your adoption fee of:\r\n          o $175 for adult dogs\r\n          o $225 for puppies under 6 months of age\r\n          o $100 for scholarship dogs (denoted by a star on the website)\r\n\r\n            This helps to defray the costs that we incur in the dog's vetting. It includes spay\/neuter, heartworm test (and treatment if necessary), heartworm prevention while they are here, Rabies vaccine, distemper vaccine, bordatella vaccine, at least 2 dewormings, Flea Treatments while they are here, any necessary grooming, full vet exam, and any other necessary veterinary work deemed appropriate by the vet. In addition, senior dogs may receive extra bloodwork and dentals. \r\n    * A fenced yard is a must for almost all collie homes. As a herding breed, collies can be car or animal chasers--it's a natural instinct. Board approval is required for collies to be adopted to homes without fences and a plan for the collie to be an indoor only dog with a leashed exercise plan will be expected. Please read this article on electric fencing to understand why we cannot approve homes that plan to leave dogs unattended in electric fences. Electric fencing used for supervised play may be considered on a case by case basis with Board approval.\r\n    * Adopter has a financial responsibility to their adopted collie to provide health care. They are expected to provide annual vaccinations and vet exams, monthly heart worm preventative, flea and tick preventative and vet care in emergencies and non-emergency situations that may arise.\r\n    * Adopter is expected to provide a good quality diet consisting of food that has good nutritional value and to stay away from \u201cbargain\u201d dog food that may be detrimental to any canines health.\r\n    * Adopter's existing animals must be vaccinated per their Veterinarian's protocol.\r\n    * Collies can not be given as gifts to other families. You can give a donation fee towards an adoption.\r\n    * Until adopters are through our full approval process, we cannot reserve dogs.\r\n    * We cannot reserve dogs for longer than one week. During the approval process, we encourage the potential adopter to prepare their home, yard and lives in general for the arrival of a new family member whether it is from CCR or elsewhere. An additional week may be given on a case-by-case basis due to situations such as the installation of a fence. If an adopter will be out of town or has a vacation planned, we ask that the adopter wait until they return in order to inquire about dogs.\r\n    * Dogs are housed with individual foster parents. Interviewers will not give out foster parent telephone numbers or addresses without specific, written foster parent approval. Interviewers will put prospective adopters in touch with foster parents through email. Visits are arranged through the foster parents based on the foster parents availability and their choice of location (might be at foster home or at a park, etc).\r\n    * Collies require a certain amount of grooming. They aren't extremely high-maintenance dogs, but an owner should plan on once weekly brushing and monthly bathing to maintain their beautiful coats.\r\n    * The pre-placement interview is for the adopter as much as it is for Collie Concern Rescue. We want to learn about what you want in your new family member in order to make the best possible match to your home. We will ask you lots of questions about your past experiences with dogs and other pets, what your current family dynamics are and your hopes for the future with your new dog. Expect for this conversation to take around an hour.\r\n    * An inspection of the new home may be requested to check the yard and environment and offer help if we see any stumbling blocks.\r\n    * If the prospective family meets all of the requirements for adoption, then they may begin inquiring about and meeting dogs in our program. If the adopter, the foster and the coordinators of Collie Concern all agree that a dog is a good fit for the family, a contract will be signed, the adoption fee will be paid to Collie Concern, and transportation will be arranged.\r\n    * On the day that the dog goes home, the adopter will meet at the prearranged location with a collar and a leash. The tags will be transferred, the paperwork given, pictures taken and maybe a few tears of happiness shed, and the dog will go home to live with his\/her new family.\r\n    * Follow-up emails will be sent to make sure the dog is doing well. If there are any problems, mentors are available to help. Visits can be made to help with training difficulties. We will always be here for you. If for any reason the adoption does not work out, Collie Concern requires that the dog be returned to our organization (not given away or turned in to a shelter).\r\n\r\n","about":"The mission of Collie Concern Rescue is to facilitate the adoption of displaced collies into loving and responsible homes and to provide a good interim quality of life for homeless collies. Our focus is on matchmaking the right collie into the right adoptive home. Collie Concern Rescue will seek to educate the public on responsible dog ownership through mentoring and post-adoption services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollie Concern Rescue will work with adopters and fosters in neighboring states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollie Concern Rescue is a non profit self funded organization established in Nov. 1994.

Because we want this to be a permanent adoption, we will place the dog in the home best suited for him\/her. We will not hold dogs for homes that are not ready to adopt yet or have not yet been approved. \r\n\r\nSentinel Dog Rescue is 100% spay\/neuter before adoption. We do NOT make exceptions so please do not ask. If we have puppies available (which is rare), they will be available to go to an adoptive home with a contract stating their spay\/neuter date, which must be kept, failure to do so, will result in immediate return of the adopted dog with no refund. (this is non negotiable) They will also have an increased adoption fee. \r\n\r\nSentinel Dog Rescue's does not adopt further then 2 hours from Ottawa. A home visit is absolutely required. If we have no one to do that home visit, we cannot adopt to that person. We have to visit and verify and counsel with each potential adopter. When we do the visits we often see something that needs to be addressed that the applicant might not think to mention. If an adoption doesn't \"click\" and the new home is far from the foster homes, it makes it extremely complicated and difficult to retrieve the animal and get him to either the original or another foster home. \r\n\r\nHere is what you need to do... Submit an online adoption application. Once you submit the application, you will receive an email or a phone call from the volunteer, who will ask you any further information, that is required from the application, and will schedule a time with you to do a home visit, should your application be approved.\r\n\r\nWe verify personal and vet references that are given on your online adoption application. A home visit is scheduled for your family. A home visit is mandatory for all adopters. This will involve a rescue volunteer coming to your home and visiting with you. All family members and pets must be present at the time of the visit. If you refuse a home visit, your application will be declined. Once your home visit is completed, your application and home visit report will then be forwarded to the Board of Directors who will either approve or decline your application for adoption. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption. We will notify you of your adoption status We will require you to sign our adoption contract and pay an adoption fee of $500. The adoption fee is listed in each dog's bio. Fees can and will increase for puppies due to the extra vet work that we must perform on them. This will help other dogs in need, just as the one you are adopting. \r\n\r\nAdoption Information: These are a few things to remember when looking to adopt a dog from us. These are only a few of our requirements, not all of them: \r\n\u00b7\tBe an adult with responsibility for maintaining a household (no students). \r\n\u00b7\tHave current identification showing address and\/or phone number. \r\n\u00b7\tHave the knowledge and consent of all adults living in household. \r\n\u00b7\tBe able to spend the time and money necessary to provide for the training, medical treatment and proper care of the pet. \r\n\u00b7\tHave the resources to make a non-refundable adoption fee. \r\n\u00b7\tAgree to provide the pet with an indoor home and be willing to consider him as a member of the family. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that all Sentinel Dog Rescue's dogs are spayed\/neutered, no exceptions. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that all pets in an adopter's home must be spayed\/neutered, no exceptions. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that children's age restriction will be based on their exposure to and experience with the breed. \r\n\u00b7\tPlace personal ID on the pet as soon as possible. \r\n\u00b7\tProvide an environment for the animal that will keep him safe and secure. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that Sentinel Dog Rescue's has the right to either deny or approve your adoption application without explanation.\r\nA Few Points To Remember: You may not be contacted until there is a dog available that might be a good match for you. Every dog will not fit into every household. It is left to the discretion of the Board of Directors, whether to approve a placement. We do not adopt out dogs to be given as gifts. If someone you know would like a dog, have that person fill out the application form. You could offer to pay the adoption fee if you would like it to be a \"gift.\" ","about":"Sentinel Dog Rescue is a non-profit organization based in Ottawa, Ontario, dedicated to rescuing homeless and abandoned animals, primarily dogs from high-kill shelters and owners who can no longer care for them. \r\n\r\nBy working with committed volunteers, foster homes, local veterinarians, and our trainer.

You will be asked to sign a contract when adopting your pet.\r\n\r\nFMAR's suggested minimum donation for an adoption ranges from $80 for a cat or kitten, $150 for mixed breed adult dogs and $175 for puppies and full breed dogs. FMAR accepts cash, checks, money orders, Visa and MasterCard.  This donation helps defray some of the cost for vet expenses incurred for each animal, including but not limited to: spay\/neuter, de-worming, heartworm testing and treatment if necessary, FeLuk\/FIV testing, vaccinations, and other medications as required. We try to do whatever it takes to insure you are adopting the healthiest animal possible.  \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the animals available for adoption are rescue animals and, as such, have often been exposed to a variety of diseases. Like human illnesses these disorders can have an incubation period up to several weeks. If the animal you adopt shows signs of illness within the first 3 days please contact the shelter right away. If the symptoms occur at any point after three days, please take it to your vet for treatment.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that we will not place a pet into a home if any of the following apply:\r\n\r\n    The prospective home currently has an un-spayed\/un-neutered pet.\r\n    The pet will be left outside unattended for long periods of time\r\n    The pet is intended as a gift.\r\n    Anyone in the household is afraid of the pet\r\n    Anyone in the household is aggressive to the pet \r\n\r\nOnce placed, FMAR reserves the right to:\r\n\r\n    Check on the pet at any time to ensure it's well-being\r\n    Remove the pet from the home if any conditions of the adoption contract have been violated or, if in the opinion of FMAR, the environment is unsafe.\r\n    IF at anytime you cannot keep your pet, you must return it to FMAR and not to any other individual or shelter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdoption Procedures \r\n\r\n    Pet Selection \u0096 This is the first step in making an informed choice of what pet is right for you and your home environment. The following are items to consider.\r\n    Size of Pet \u0096 Is your home environment suitable for a large pet? If you live in a building with various pet controls, is there a limit to the size of the pet? If you rent, please bring a copy of your lease indicating that pets are allowed and what the limitations are.\r\n    Energy Level and Exercise Needs \u0096 Does your home and surrounding area have easy access to a safe exercise area? If you have a yard, is it adequately fenced? Is your fence tall enough for the type of dog which you have interest in (many dogs can scale a 4 foot fence)? If you don't have a fence do you have a plan for potty breaks? Do you have the time in your day to provide the needed exercise and companionship for this pet?\r\n    Compatibility \u0096 Do you have children or do children visit often? If so, does the pet you chose get along with children? Do you have other pets \u0096 does the pet you chose get along with the types of other animals in your home? If you are adopting a dog and you already have a dog (s) at home you will be required to bring him\/her with you when you visit. You will also be required to bring everyone else living in the home.\r\n\r\nAdoption Application\r\n\r\nFMAR's adoption application is used to match our adoptable pets with the best environments, lifestyles, and owner expectations. Please be honest when filling out the form and when talking to an FMAR adoption team member. All applications are reviewed by an FMAR team member for approval.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to attend an FMAR event it will help the process move faster if you can download the questionnaire, fill it out and bring it with you. If you would like to submit an application via email, you can scan it and forward it to shelter1@comcast.net. Questionnaires (applications) are available on our website at http:\/\/www.fmar1.org\/adoption_requirements0.aspx  Please do not mail applications to FMAR as the animal may already be adopted by the time it reaches us.\r\n\r\nAttend an Adoption Event to Meet an Animal\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to come to an adoption event to meet one of our adoptable animals. Please email the shelter at shelter1@comcast.net with the pets name, and the event you would like to meet him\/her at. Please send your request no later than three days prior to the event.\r\n\r\nAdoption Contract\r\n\r\nAfter the pet has been chosen and the adoption questionnaire approved, the adopting family will be given a packet and asked to sign a contract. Included in the packet will be the pet's medical records, pet tips and other informational hand outs, including a packet with instructions on how to activate your free month of health insurance. Please make sure you check your email as soon as you get home and follow the instructions if you do not receive the email. \r\n\r\nFMAR's goal is to make your adoption experience a pleasant one for both your family and the pet. We will do our best to fit the right pet with your family. If you have any questions during the process please feel free to ask. All questions are important to ensure the pet and family have the best possible start as well as continued success.    \r\n\r\n","about":"FMAR is a no-kill animal shelter.

Many of the volunteers have been rescuing Airedales for years with very little assistance. In 2003, we started this website as a way to coordinate communication and cooperation to help homeless Airedales in the southwestern states. SouthWest Airedale Terrier (SWAT) Rescue is not an organization or corporation. We are an informal association of independent rescue volunteers. Each volunteer is responsible for the rescued Airedales in their care. Each of us operates in a slightly different fashion, but we all have one thing in common: we are dedicated to finding the perfect home for each individual Airedale in our care. \r\n\r\nSWAT volunteers include Airedale pet owners & breeders who believe we have a responsibility not only for our own dogs and the dogs we produce, but for the Airedale breed as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe SWAT volunteers have full-time jobs, families, and animals of their own and many work more hours doing rescue work than they do at their full-time jobs. While SWAT volunteers make every effort to return phone calls\/emails promptly, this may not always happen. Please, be patient with us. Emergency calls about the safety of Airedales take priority. \r\n\r\nEach volunteer of the Southwest Airedale Terrier Rescue network has the following goals: \r\nTo rescue any purebred Airedale in our area without a responsible owner or breeder. \r\nBefore placement, each rescued Airedale Terrier will be: \r\nspayed or neutered \r\npermanently identified with a microchip \r\nchecked for heartworm, parasites and other health issues \r\nbrought up to date on vaccinations required by law and \r\nappropriate to the age and health of the Airedale, \r\ncarefully evaluated for temperament & personality \r\nin order to be matched with an appropriate home \r\nbathed and groomed \r\nPlace each rescued Airedale Terriers into the loving forever home best suited to the needs of that particular Airedale. \r\nEducate the public regarding the Airedale breed and responsible dog ownership. \r\nNo SWAT volunteer conducts rescue activities for personal profit. All profits from fundraising activities, fees and donations will be used only for the benefit of rescued Airedales.

We also have a program for dogs with special needs, including shy and deaf dogs. A well-trained dog with a positive behavior is one that will adjust well into a new adoptive family!

By ignoring their plight, we risk perpetuating cat and dog overpopulation, with dire consequences.  Our objective is to reduce the number of animals left uncared for and homeless.  Our approach is to provide direct care, partner with supportive businesses, organizations and individuals to provide rescue services ranging from feeding to veterinary care to finding temporary and permanent homes for these animals.  We also are committed to the idea that education is essential in alleviating the conditions of animal homelessness and abuse and strive to bring awareness through various community and school programs.

Not only is this the best way to save Houston\u0092s shelter pets from euthanasia, but we believe it will be the impetus in helping Houston shelters become no-kill shelters. Working with BARC in late summer of 2013 alone, Rescued Pets Movement has saved more than 450 pets by transporting them to Colorado.\r\n","meetPets":"We are a foster based group so we do not have a facility.

Because we want this to be a permanent adoption, we will place the dog in the home best suited for him\/her. We will not hold dogs for homes that are not ready to adopt yet or have not yet been approved.\r\n\r\nGenesis Dog Rescue is 100% spay\/neuter before adoption. We do NOT make exceptions so please do not ask. If we have puppies available (which is rare), they will be available to go to an adoptive home with a contract stating their spay\/neuter date, which must be kept, failure to do so, will result in immediate return of the adopted dog with no refund. (this is non negotiable) They will also have an increased adoption fee.\r\n\r\nGenesis Dog Rescue's does not adopt further then 2 hours from Ottawa. A home visit is absolutely required. If we have no one to do that home visit, we cannot adopt to that person. We have to visit and verify and counsel with each potential adopter. When we do the visits we often see something that needs to be addressed that the applicant might not think to mention. If an adoption doesn't \"click\" and the new home is far from the foster homes, it makes it extremely complicated and difficult to retrieve the animal and get him to either the original or another foster home.\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to do... Submit an online adoption application. Once you submit the application, you will receive an email or a phone call from the volunteer, who will ask you any further information, that is required from the application, and will schedule a time with you to do a home visit, should your application be approved.\r\n\r\nWe verify personal and vet references that are given on your online adoption application. A home visit is scheduled for your family. A home visit is mandatory for all adopters. This will involve a rescue volunteer coming to your home and visiting with you. All family members and pets must be present at the time of the visit. If you refuse a home visit, your application will be declined. Once your home visit is completed, your application and home visit report will then be forwarded to the Board of Directors who will either approve or decline your application for adoption. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption. We will notify you of your adoption status We will require you to sign our adoption contract and pay an adoption fee of $300.00 to $400.00 but this can and will vary depending on the dog you are adopting. The adoption fee is listed in each dog's bio. Fees can and will increase for puppies due to the extra vet work that we must perform on them. This will help other dogs in need, just as the one you are adopting.\r\n\r\nAdoption Information: These are a few things to remember when looking to adopt a dog from us. These are only a few of our requirements, not all of them:\r\n\r\n    Be an adult with responsibility for maintaining a household (no students).\r\n    Have current identification showing address and\/or phone number.\r\n    Have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in household.\r\n    Be able to spend the time and money necessary to provide for the training, medical treatment and proper care of the pet.\r\n    Have the resources to make a non-refundable adoption fee.\r\n    Agree to provide the pet with an indoor home and be willing to consider him as a member of the family.\r\n    Understand that all Genesis Dog Rescue's dogs are spayed\/neutered, no exceptions.\r\n    Understand that all pets in an adopter's home must be spayed\/neutered, no exceptions.\r\n    Understand that children's age restriction will be based on their exposure to and experience with the breed.\r\n    Place personal ID on the pet as soon as possible.\r\n    Provide an environment for the animal that will keep him safe and secure.\r\n    Understand that Genesis Dog Rescue has the right to either deny or approve your adoption application without explanation.\r\n\r\nA Few Points To Remember: You may not be contacted until there is a dog available that might be a good match for you. Every dog will not fit into every household. It is left to the discretion of the Board of Directors, whether to approve a placement. We do not adopt out dogs to be given as gifts. If someone you know would like a dog, have that person fill out the application form. You could offer to pay the adoption fee if you would like it to be a \"gift.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an adoption application and adoption contract, there is a home visit and references to be done before an adoption can be considered.","about":"Genesis Dog Rescue is a non-profit organization based in Ottawa, Ontario.

I have several foster homes in various areas, and I also post pictures for people who need help finding a home for their pet, which many times has been successful.

There have  been a few pets that haven't been able to find a home through this service, but it depends on what the pet is and who is looking on the internet.  When we have space available we take transfers from a local kill animal shelter.  We also step in and help people who find themselves with multiple animals and no way to pay to get them fixed.  Usually I will get all the females fixed to get their circumstances under control, and in some cases I will also help with donated food when I have extra.  If they want to find homes for some of the many pets they have accumulated, then I will place their pictures on the internet for them.  We don't euthanize unless a pet is seriously ill.","meetPets":"It depends on who has the pet.

Our rescue efforts focus on Westchester County, New York, primarily in the southern end of the county.\r\nWe often work with other rescue groups and shelters, most of whom have insufficient space for all of their cats to roam freely. Our philosophy is that no cat should be caged,  except when needed to address temporary medical issues. We believe that cats need room to play, lounge and interact with each other and humans in an open environment. \r\nOur facility currently consists of six rooms for cats. Each room has ample windows, pet beds, scratching posts, cat trees, and lots of toys to keep the cats stimulated throughout the day. We designate space for newly rescued cats to be isolated while recovering from spay or neuter surgery until it can be determined which other cats they will get along best with until adopted.  We also offer critical aftercare space for ferals in our TNR (Trap Neuter Release)  program that aims to stop animal overpopulation. \r\nWe currently work with other groups to assist dogs in need, and hope to expand and be able to help more directly.\r\n","meetPets":"By appointment or at advertised adoption events","services":"Adoptions, spay\/neuter\/TNR","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Before choosing your new companion, think about how much time you have to spend with him. Consider the time involved: a healthy puppy can live for 15 to 20 years! Remember that settling in a new four-legged family member can take some time and adjustment. Bear in mind that just like us, your companion animal will need food and supplies and have to visit a doctor from time to time.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to visit our animals in the Shelter, at our satellite adoption facility inside PetSmart (3561 Zafarano Drive) or online. Once you have an idea what you\u2019re looking for, one of our adoption counselors will visit with you and share some ideas about which of our residents would be best suited to you.\r\n\r\nAll animals are spayed or neutered and microchipped before leaving and receive the required age-appropriate vaccines. For your convenience, the required licenses for City and County residents are available at the Shelter as you adopt!\r\n\r\nAdoption is a partnership between the adopter, the Shelter and the animal. We are committed to making that partnership work for everyone.\r\n\r\nDog\/Cat Adoption Fees\r\n\r\nDog\/Cat adoption fees range from fee-waived (thanks to our generous contributors) to $400. Our adoption fees help to offset the cost of evaluation, housing, feeding and medical care for the thousands of animals who come through our doors. We try to keep our adoption prices reasonable while generating income to care for all animals in our care until we can place them in a loving home.\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee for each animal varies and is dependent on many factors including: age, size, behavior, medical condition and public demand.\r\n\r\nAll animals are available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Holds are available when the animal is ready for adoption. Please read How to Place an Animal on Hold.\r\n\r\nShelter Heroes\r\n\r\nSome of the animals in our adoption center are Shelter Heroes. These dogs\/cats are those who are in high demand and quickly find a loving home. You will notice that our Shelter Hero animals have a higher adoption price \u2013 this is because they leave a financial legacy for the other animals in our care who may need extensive medical care or more time to find a loving home.\r\n\r\nShelter Heroes are available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Paid holds are available when the dog\/cat is ready for adoption.","about":"Who We Are\r\n\r\nThe Santa Fe Animal Shelter is the largest animal shelter and care facility in northern New Mexico. We serve more than 10,000 lost, stray, abandoned or injured animals each year. As a private, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, we receive nearly all of our funding through private donors in our community and beyond. The Shelter contracts with the City and County of Santa Fe to care for homeless and stray animals, but also serves every animal brought through our front doors from any other source. We work to reunite people with their lost animal companions, and re-home those animals that have gone unclaimed into new homes through our adoption program. Low- and no-cost spay\/neuter programs address the overpopulation problems that our community faces. Humane education programs in our local schools teach children to respect and care for all living creatures. Partnered with our community, we work for change in the lives of our companion animals and to end the suffering of all animals.\r\n\r\nA Brief History\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2005, the Santa Fe Animal Shelter left its home of 66 years\u2014the only home the organization had ever known\u2014and moved to our new, two-building, 100-acre campus. We left a structure that had helped us serve thousands upon thousands of animals for the better part of seven decades. And while that home held so much history and love, the needs of our community meant we needed more. Thanks to a partnership with the City of Santa Fe and the Bureau of Land management, we moved to a parcel of land with hiking trails, room to walk dogs, and amazing sunsets. After a multi-year fundraising drive, the first phase was completed: two beautiful new buildings in which we can provide a higher level of care to the animals in our community. The Lapides Adoption Center serves healthy, adoptable animals. Every detail of the new Shelter is designed for the comfort and health of the animals. From the tiled banco in each dog kennel to the spacious, cozy, cat colony rooms; from the radiant floor heating for our four-footed visitors to \u201ccuddle\u201d rooms where potential adopters can visit with an animal in an area designed to simulate a home environment. The second building, the Robin Sommers Animal Receiving & Care Center, allows us much more room to house stray and abandoned animals as we care for them during their stay with us. High-tech ventilation systems allow us to better control the spread of contagious diseases and to safely treat the animals in our care much more effectively. A third building, The Clare Eddy Thaw Hospital, was completed in the summer of 2013 and proudly opened to further serve the needs of the community. We welcome you to visit the new haven we are providing to the animals of our community. Two five-acre dog parks are available so that the Shelter will not just be a place to adopt an animal or find a missing one, but one to visit over and over again. We have built this Shelter for you, our community, to use as a resource and a place to find joy with the animals. The staff of the Santa Fe Animal Shelter brings years of collective experience in animal welfare and related fields to the Shelter. For more information about the Shelter, please contact the appropriate person below.","meetPets":" Please note: Animals for adoption or lost animals may only be visited during\r\nKennel hours of operation.\r\n\r\nAdoption Desk:\r\n\r\n9:00 am to 5:00 pm - seven days a week\r\n\r\nAdoption Kennel hours (for viewing):\r\n\r\n11:00 am to 5:00 pm - seven days a week\r\n\r\nReceiving Desk:\r\n\r\n9:00 am to 5:00 pm daily\r\n\r\nReceiving Kennel hours (for viewing):\r\n\r\n11:00 am to 5:00 pm daily","services":"","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

However, we are continuing the activities we did for another rescues, For Paws Sake, Inc., in our county.\r\nLori and I have been in rescue for over 25 years combined.  Lori has rescued all over the US and Peurto Rico while her husband was in the service.  Lori is a teacher at a private school and takes her animals into the classroom.  The kids are rewarded by being able to help her with bottle feeding and care of puppies and sick animals.   It is just another incentive for learning. In her math classes they are taught to figure out doses for the animal and ozs to be fed.  \r\nDianne is retired and works for the animals as a full time job.  She works very closely with the local Animal Control.   Hometown is very active in raising funds for the local AC to provide Parvo, Distemper, and Bordatella shots for each animal that enters the Shelter.   In that way we are lowering the breakout rate in the Shelter and once animals are claimed or adopted in the community.   We hold monthly vaccine clinics with $10 shots for Rabies, Parvo\/Distemper, Bordatella, and Feline Distemper.  Micro Chips including registration are $20.  We plan to implement a spay\/neuter program in AC and for the public the beginning of next year. \r\nWhy we do it? To improve the quality life and health of the animals in our community, thus improving the quality of life of the humans who live here. Our Mission statment pretty well says it.  Hometown Animal Rescue, Inc is a group of volunteers dedicated to the rescue, sanctuary and re homing of local stray and neglected dogs.  We work in alliance with the local animal control to build an animal friendly community, encourage respect and compassion for all animals and advocate responsible pet ownership.  Hometown Animal Rescue, Inc will accomplish this through educating the public on the importance of spay\/neuter and general pet care and health.  We will set the example of humane care and treatment through our rescue efforts and demonstrate pet owner responsibility we want current and future pet owners to emulate.  It is our desire that other counties see the success of our network of supporters and volunteers and thus implement similar programs to benefit the animals and citizens of their own community.","meetPets":"Since we are a group of foster homes all our adooptions are done at PetSmart through the PetSmart Charities program or at other places of business.

According to industry breeding reports published in The Greyhound Review, there were 77,852 litters registered by the National Greyhound Association between 1989 and 2000.  Multiplied by a conservative average of 6.52 pups per litter, the result shows that more than 507,596 greyhounds were born curing that twelve-year period.  Their lives are difficult from the outset.  In order to track the dogs for racing, greyhound puppies are tattooed by three months of age and are individually registered by 18 months.  Of those born, only 78% of those puppies were individually registered during the same twelve-year period.  Because very few are ever found wandering, the 22% not registered are presumed dead.  On average, a revolving baseline of 1,000 dogs is needed to sustain a racetrack operation.  In 2000, approximately 26,500 greyhounds entered the racing system, and an equal or greater number of greyhounds, aged between 2 and 5 years old, exited the system.  Approximately 13,000 dogs were retired to rescue groups for adoption, leaving approximately 13,500 unaccounted for.  This sport has conservatively claimed the lives of more than 1,000,000 greyhounds in its 75-year U.S. history.\r\nKCREGAP is a 501c3 not-for-profit organization. KCREGAP is dedicated to finding loving homes for retired greyhounds. Since its inception, 4000 greys have been adopted into loving homes in the KC Metro area and beyond. The reality is that, because of poor track standards, many beautiful greyhounds come to us with health issues requiring veterinary attention. The adoption fee charged by KCREGAP does not cover the actual costs incurred in treating these dogs. Costs often climb into the thousands of dollars. \r\n","meetPets":"We have weekly adoption clinics at various locations throughout the KC Metro area.

Collins, Longmont & Loveland, Angels with Paws takes in unwanted and homeless animals, many of which have injuries, illness, disabilities, special needs and other conditions (most caused by neglect, abandonment, abuse & worse), older adults (over the age of 6), and those who just need some patience and compassion (most of which would have been put-down by or turned away from other shelters).   We provide veterinary and other care, food, litter, etc. and a place for them to live until they are adopted.   We also promote and educate the public on responsible pet ownership, the need to spay\/neuter and the cruelty of declawing.","meetPets":"The Angels with Paws Shelter at 2540 Youngfield St., Lakewood, CO 80215 every day (except holidays) from 1 - 6 p.m., Petsmart Applewood on Youngfield, Petsmart Stapleton in Denver, Petco Golden, Petco Littleton on Wads. & Crestline, Petco Denver I-25 & Colo., Petco Aurora on Quincy, Petco Park Meadows and both Petco and Petsmart in Ft.

If the adopter cannot care for their rabbit, they must return it to Ohio House Rabbit Rescue.\r\n\r\nTo adopt a rabbit, potential adopters must first fill out an application for a rabbit they are interested in. Then, they are interviewed by OHRR Adoption Coordinators.

Our mission is to establish and operate a Center for rescued abandoned pet rabbits, offer a robust adoption program and provide educational resources and programming on the proper care of rabbits as indoor companions.  OHRR envisions a community where all pet rabbits live indoors as companions and have access to a proper diet, habitat, and regular veterinary care for the duration of their life.\r\n\r\nOHRR was founded in 2009 by longtime rabbit owner, Beverly May.  After realizing that over 900 rabbits were offered for surrender each year in Central Ohio alone, Beverly decided that Ohio needed a rescue and adoption center for rabbits.  OHRR began with an extensive network of foster homes in order to begin rescuing rabbits and to build community support. In 2013, OHRR opened the Ohio House Rabbit Adoption Center, which is the first rescue and adoption center in Ohio that is exclusively for rabbits. In 2013, we founds homes for over 70 bunnies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our adoptions program, OHRR hosts Midwest BunFest, the largest rabbit-related exposition in the Eastern United States. BunFest includes shopping from various small animal supply vendors, the Bunny Spa with nail trips and grooming, Bunny Glamour Shots pet photography, a chance to interact with rabbit rescues across the Midwest, and also has over 10 education sessions from nationally recognized veterinarians and certified rabbit educators. In 2012, OHRR developed the Fix-a-Bun (FAB) Low-Cost Spay\/Neuter program that provides assistance in paying for spay\/neuter surgery for rabbits in Ohio, and the program has helped many families pay for spay\/neuter surgery. Further, OHRR attends adoption events at local pet supply stores on an ongoing basis and hosts community fundraisers quarterly. OHRR also provides email and telephone support to rabbit owners across Ohio and in other states.\r\n","meetPets":"Potential adopters can visit our adoptable bunnies at the Ohio House Rabbit Adoption Center located at 5485 N.

The Network arranges for emergency rescues throughout the country, and gathers information designed to match appropriate permanent and temporary homes. It is funded by donations and supported by Jack Russell Terrier lovers and volunteers throughout the world. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the dogs that end up in Rescue are unwanted simply for being Jack Russells by nature and behavior. Owners often find that they were unprepared for the care required for this high energy terrier; they did not understand the nature of the breed, and their instinctive desire to hunt. Owners are often gone all day, and therefore unable to provide the time, attention, and strenuous exercise this little dog requires. We would like to emphasize that JR's need an active lifestyle, as they are hunting dogs by instinct. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Russell Rescue, Inc. is to have this unique hunting terrier be in the protective care of those who thoroughly understand this dog. This is a very unique dog that arrives in any life with a special set of needs not suited to everyone. They get into trouble. If they cannot find trouble, they create it. If bored, they can apply their extreme intelligence in destructive ways. They require an educated owner and a loving caretaker willing to provide what this dog needs to be happy and safe. Most of life with them involves protecting them from themselves and their own demise. They rarely lack courage and don't take to abuse, even accidental abuse.","meetPets":"An application must be filled out before an appointment can be set up to meet any of our JRTs.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Many of these dogs live in desperate conditions, where they have to fight to stay alive each day on the street. It is a heart-wrenching site for any animal lover, and once you have seen one of these adorable dogs it is impossible not to want to do something to help them. And this is where the story of starting Pet Project Rescue begins...\r\n\r\nDuring the time on Isla we had the opportunity to meet Alison Sawyer Current and visit her rescue, Isla Animals Rescue. Alison could easily be called the guardian angel of Isla dogs. Like Alison, we instantly fell in love with all the wonderful street animals on the island. The many, many street dogs on Isla spend their days looking for food and avoiding the many taxis that will not hesitate to hit any dog in their way. Luckily, these dogs also have a number of wonderful people looking out for them. Isla Animals volunteers work to find street dogs that need to be spayed, neutered, or given other medical care, and when possible taken into foster-care. Some of the dogs on the island are feral and would not do well in foster-care, but many other street dogs want nothing more than a person to cuddle up with on the couch. These dogs are fostered at Alison's home, and a few other volunteers' homes when needed. The dogs are given the vet care that they require, and the love and affection that they have been needing for a long time. It never ceases to amaze us how trusting and sweet these dogs are after all the terrible things that people have done to them. We often say that these dogs know they have finally found the good life and will show you every day how happy they are to be with you!\r\n\r\nOnce the dogs are ready for adoption they are flown to us in MN, and are placed in foster homes until they are adopted. We continue to provide vet care and training for the dogs while they are in Pet Project Rescue foster homes.\r\n\r\nAs of April 2009 PPR also began working with our local animal control to rescue local cats and dogs. We strongly support the animals in our local area as well, and because of this all our cats are rescued from local high kill shelters. About 85% of our dogs also come from local high kills shelters and are placed in foster homes until they are adopted.\r\n\r\nBecause these animals share our homes with us we are able to really get to know their personalities, and are then able to let you know which dog or cat would be the best fit for your lifestyle. We also strive to make sure that each adoption is a forever home for our animals. To assure this we are here to support our adoptive homes with questions and concerns about their new family member if they arise. We also require an application and home visit prior to adoption.\r\n\r\nThese animals know the hard life, and they know the good life...and they will let you know each and every day how happy they are to be a member of your family! Please consider a Pet Project Rescue animal (from Mexico or MN) as your next pet, and THANK YOU for considering a rescue dog or cat for your family!","meetPets":"We do adoptions 7 days a week out of our foster homes.

From the Board of Directors to our Foster Caretakers to our Event Staff, each volunteer gives generously of their time and skills, motivated solely by a desire to help animals.\r\n\r\nA Second Chance Puppies and Kittens Rescue combines a no-nonsense goal of saving animals' lives with the blood, sweat, and tears of countless volunteers with financial support from various donors (individuals and corporations alike). Now in its sixth year, the group has rescued over 5,000 animals and continues to grow rapidly thanks in large part due to established relationships with various pet supply stores in Palm Beach County, including PetSmart and PETCO.\r\n\r\nAll of the grant writing, fundraising, application reviewing, event planning, supply collection, bathing and bottle feeding is done by volunteers who seek only to save the lives of pets. When opening their hearts just isn\u2019t enough for some, they open their doors - fostering dogs and cats in need until they are adopted. Their dedication has made the group one of the largest no-kill rescue groups without a shelter.\r\n\r\nRescuing and arranging adoptions into loving homes for so many animals and successfully treating dozens of heartworm positive dogs are monumental tasks that have not gone unnoticed by the local media. The Palm Beach Post, The Wellington Town Crier and The Observer have all written articles promoting the group and its goal of finding homes for homeless pets.\r\n\r\nAccomplishing our goal of saving homeless pets\u2019 lives by providing them with safe, healthy foster environments until they are adopted by loving forever families, requires funding to pay for the food and medical needs of the rescued animals. Donated funds go directly to covering food and supplies, veterinary expenses and medical supplies, and overhead costs (printing of forms, webpage hosting, etc.). A Second Chance Puppies and Kittens Rescue relies solely on donations. We do not receive any government funding or grants.\r\n\r\nWe hope that after all you\u2019ve learned about us, you will join us in our effort to save the homeless animals.   ","meetPets":"We do not have a shelter location where you can come to meet the animals.  We are 100% volunteer and our animals are kept in private foster homes until they are ready for adoption.\r\n\r\nWe have weekly events as listed on our website under the Events Link, where you can come to see the pups, but if one of your choices is pre-approved for an online application it would not be available for adoption.\r\n\r\nIt is best to pick one of your favorites, and get an application in so it can be reviewed.  That way, if it is approved, you would be able to come to the event and choose from what is available at that time.  Keep in mind though, an approval for one particular dog or puppy does not guarantee approval for another, we have to make sure the pup is going to the best possible forever home.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

He had even laid on my head during blinding migraines! Since that time SRC has flourished and we have been blessed to have placed more than 2500 Schnauzers and Honorary Schnauzers in loving adoptive homes!  Each one stays in a loving foster home and comes from trauma of horrible conditions!  They are so glad to be rescued from the horror of puppy mills and kill facilities and with time and understanding become fantastic pets!  SRC also publicly promotes spay\/neuter for all animals and works to educate the public on the desperate need for this policy.  We work to do micro-chip clinics to help the elderly be able to keep their dogs healthy despite their lack of income.  We also work to place adult dogs with senior adoptive parents.

Our adoption fee is $50.00.  NAFA does long distance adoptions - individuals must be willing to drive to Jonesboro to meet the dog they are interested in and visit with our director.  For individuals more than 60 miles away, NAFA must have a working relationship with a rescue or shelter in your area.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for adoption is \u2026 \r\n\r\nVisit our pet adoption and meet the puppy. Complete a potential home questionnaire. Complete an Interview with the director.  Not everyone who applies to adopt an animal is a good match.   \r\n\r\nIf after those step you and the director agree that your home and the dog are a good match, a bandanna is placed on the dog and you complete the adoption with our adoption counselor. \r\n\r\nThe puppy has received the first set of vaccinations, deworming and is on heartworm preventative.  Adult dogs are current on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on heartworm preventative.   \r\n\r\nAll pets adopted from NAFA are microchipped and registered to your name and address. \r\n\r\nWe provide a bag of food of the type food the puppy has been eating, along with stress vitamins to help with the transition from the foster home and its litter mates to you. \r\n\r\nWe provide a reward tag for the dog to wear just in case it gets lost, someone will call for the reward and we can get the pet back to you. \r\n\r\nAll pets are covered by 30 days shelter care insurance. \r\n\r\nThe adoption contract you sign has 19 items of importance, the top four state that you agree to: \r\n\r\nCome back the next Saturday after adoption to bring paperwork showing you have had the dog to the vet for its next set of vaccinations. (This can be done by fax if you live more than 1.5 hours away from Jonesboro)\r\n \r\nHave the puppy spayed\/neutered before it is 5 months of age and provide proof of this.  Most adults are already altered unless our veterinarian suggests waiting for 30 to 60 days.  Your adoption is not complete until proof of spay\/neuter is received.  \r\n\r\nTake the pet to your veterinarian for the next set of vaccinations and to purchase heartworm preventative the Tuesday after you adopt.\r\n \r\nCome back the fifth or sixth Saturday after adoption for a final check-in and mini training session.  This is mandatory unless you live more than 2 hours away.  Then it can be done by email or telephone. \r\n\r\nReturn the dog to NAFA should circumstances change and you are not able to keep the dog.  \r\n","about":"In the past 11 years NAFA has been responsible for and assisted with the rescue of thousands of dogs and cats from puppy mills, catteries, class B dealers, backyard breeders, pet stores and individuals.\r\n\r\n     NAFA has no shelter.

They are friendly and social and very affectionate! Our dogs are spayed or neutered (if old enough), up to date on vaccines, wormed, heartworm and lyme tested (and on preventative, once old enough), and free of fleas and ticks. We temperament test our adult dogs and they are all suitable for many family situations. Our dogs are well mannered, know some basic commands, and are usually housebroken within a week of being with us (if old enough). They are in our family\/home situation at this time (not in kennels or crates, although most are crate trained) and are worked with daily. All of our dogs do well with other dogs and many do well with cats. Adoption donations vary with age, breed, and training of the dog (minimum is $300). (We do not place puppies or small dogs with kids under 6 and reserve the right to match who WE FEEL would be the best homes for our dogs.)

Initially it was a dream.  Soon a blue print for implementation of this dream was in place. Finally a strategy for changes that would most significantly impact the inhumane conditions of these precious pets was arrived at.  Then, in 1997, New Leash On Life Animal Rescue was born, thanks to Bobby & Kelly Dorafshar. \r\n\r\nSince its inception, New Leash On Life has been responsible for spaying and neutering thousands of pets, rescuing and placing over 3,000 dogs, providing free educational seminars at local shelters, setting shelter rescue priorities on \u201chard to place\u201d animals requiring medical or special care, founding the P.E.T.\u2019s program (Pet Educational Trainers) and co-founding Partners for Life which saved hundreds at the East Valley Animal Shelter. Finally in March of 2002, a lease was signed on thirteen acres in the Santa Clarita Valley for our E.R.A Center (Education, Rehabilitation and Adoption) which serves as a safe haven for many companion animals and a learning resource for children and adults facilitating New Leash On Life\u2019s dream of making Los Angeles a no-kill city.\r\n\r\nWe've recently developed our Lend a Paw program, rescuing dogs from the shelter and training them as assistance and therapy dogs for people and children in need.  In addition to our Lend a Paw training program, we are implementing a training program for all of our rescues.  It is our goal to put each dog rescued from the shelter through an obedience training course prior to being placed for adoption.  A very select few may be chosen for Lend a Paw, while most will be adopted to loving families immediately.  By training each dog, the adoptive family has a better chance of developing a better bond and a permanent relationship.  In addition, our dogs get a lot of human attention from our training volunteers while they wait for their new home.\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"New Leash On Life Animal Rescue, visits by appointment only!","services":"adoptions, boarding, training social-therapy dogs","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

The adoptive owner agrees to submit a DPMU Adoption Update Form on the animal(s) each year on or before the date of adoption until DPMU deems this is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAll animal(s) will go to the best\/most appropriate home that we feel meets the horses needs. Our fees are based on what it cost us to procure the animal and pay vet and shipping costs.\r\n\r\nAny animal adopted from DPMU may not be moved to a new location or leased or loaned to another person without prior approval from DPMU. DPMU also reserves the right of first refusal if for any reason the adoptive owner is unable or unwilling to maintain the animal properly.\r\n\r\nDreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation cannot guarantee any animal(s) as to its disposition or training.

We have gentled and trained more than one hundred horses from the drug industry, and eighty horses from abuse, abandonment, and feedlots. The majority of our horses are totally wild (untouched by humans) when they arrive here. We are one of very few facilities that can gentle and train a wild horse - our secret is common sense, time, gentleness, and patience. On average, the length of time a rescued horse spends with us is one year.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to rescue and\/or purchase these animals to give them housing, feeding, and gentling with the hope to place them into loving, permanent homes through our adoption program.","meetPets":"Daily at the ranch","services":"adoptions, rescue, and rehabilitation","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Flight\r\ncosts, travel cages, pre-flight veterinary exams and export paperwork can run anywhere from\r\n$300 to $1000 depending on a number of variables (which airline, the absence or presence of a\r\nflight volunteer, the size of the dog, the size of the travel cage, whether any boarding is\r\nrequired during transit).\r\nWe feel it is important to outline these costs here, since although the low end is comparable to\r\nmany animal shelter and rescue adoption fees, the high end can potentially be prohibitive for\r\nsome adopters. We also feel it is imperative to point out that the remainder of the transit cost,\r\nleft over after what is paid for by you, must be funded by ISDF.\r\nAlthough some of our adoptable dogs have flights that have been paid for partially or even fully\r\nby ISDF fundraising efforts, there are always other costs involved with transport: extra\r\npaperwork, pet taxis, boarding at layover sites, cargo fees and taxes when we pick up the dogs\r\nat the airport - as well as fostering, feeding, and veterinary care costs spent prior to flying and\r\nafter flying, but before adoption.\r\nAdditionally, most of our dogs are not funded in full, despite our best efforts, so we must\r\nconstantly borrow against helping future dogs for fees outside what we fundraised. With this in\r\nmind, please understand that we suggest a minimum donation of $300, if at all possible (again,\r\nto reiterate, we would never want adoption costs to drive away potential adopters, so please\r\nknow this is a guideline for giving only) so that we may continue to help the maximum number\r\nof seriously needy dogs.\r\nWith no paid staff and no overhead costs, 100% of all donations from adoption fees and our\r\nfundraising efforts goes towards helping not only the dog you adopt, but all others going\r\nforward in future. The more ISDF must pay out per dog, the less we are able to help\r\nthe many others awaiting homes of their own.\r\nWe are happy to go over your particular dog's estimated costs in greater detail during the home\r\nvisit, should you have more questions - but at this time, we would like an idea of what you\r\nthink you would be able to cover.

Usually, though, most owners in this situation turn their pets over to the county-run Animal Control facilities, and there is a 70 percent chance the dog will be euthanized.  An owner surrendered older dog or and cat, or poorly-socialized purebreds, mixed breeds, and sick or injured dogs are usually euthanized immediately. The others might be put up for adoption, but with so many animals coming in each day, often there is no room to keep even the healthy, adoptable ones for very long in these shelters.\r\n\r\nThis is where Perfect Pets Rescue, Inc. steps in. We rescue most of our dogs  from area shelters and once rescued, they are vaccinated, treated for intestinal and external parasites and are spayed or neutered. Sometimes, dogs need to get medical treatment beyond this.\r\n\r\nAll animals are fostered and get used to the \"good life\".  Eventually, every dog is placed in the kind of home where it will never again know the fear and pain it has lived with most, if not all, of its life.\r\n\r\nIn time, an amazing transformation occurs. Their emotional, physical and spiritual wounds heal.  Scared dogs are transformed into healthy, playful, affectionate pets. They learn to play.  They learn to trust. They learn to live without fear or confusion. They become the pets they were meant to be and live the lives they were meant to live. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that we are a small registered non-profit 501(c)(3) organization at this time, and can only rescue few dogs at a time. Volunteers willing to open their hearts and their homes to our rescue dogs are also crucial to our continued success. We want to express a heartfelt \"thank you\" to our foster homes that opened their heart and homes to one of our wonderful dogs. We couldn't do it without you guys!\r\n","meetPets":"Adoption visits are by appointment, as all of our pets are in private foster homes.

We do this because we love these wonderful creatures and we want to place as many as we can into their forever homes.\r\nOur dogs come from several sources. First and foremost from owner turn-ins, these are dogs whose owners can no longer care for them. We take the dog into our organization rather than having the dog turned over to the Humane Society or Animal Care and Control. There is great value bringing these dogs into our program. They are less likely to be exposed to disease or suffer mental stress by moving from a home situation to a smaller program such as ours. The transition for the dog to the new home is much easier. Owner turn-ins also allow us to have a more complete history of the dog. We participate in the Maricopa County Animal Care & Control New Hope Program. The program allows us to intake dogs that are slated to be euthanized, often for no other reason than a lack of space. In addition, we work with other rescue groups who may not have room for a specific dog.\r\n\r\nOnce we intake a dog it usually will spend time in a foster home. Our foster homes are all volunteers that care for their foster dogs as if they were their own. This includes working on housebreaking, basic training, grooming and medical care. All dogs available for adoption have had a basic veterinary checkup, have current vaccinations and a micro chip.\r\n","meetPets":"Our organization is foster-based.

It does not \u00e2\u0080\u009cbind\u00e2\u0080\u009d an applicant to the specified animal that they complete the application for, it merely is a request to meet an available STAR animal.\r\n\r\nApplication Review- All Applications are thoroughly reviewed. If the applicant may be the right match for the animal, it will be forwarded to the foster caregiver for review.  If the foster caregiver feels that their foster animal would be a good fit for the potential adopter; he or she will contact the applicant to answer questions about the animal and make arrangements for a meet and greet.\r\nPlease understand that it is very important to find the right match for both the animal and the adopter.  An application that is not approved for a certain animal does not necessarily mean that the adopter would not make a great pet guardian; it merely means that the adoption may not have been the right match.\r\n\r\nApproval to go Forward with a Meet and Greet- Meet and greets are scheduled with the foster caregiver and the potential adopter.  These can be done at any convenient location for the foster caregiver.  Adoption events would be the preferred location, but often time they are done at the caregiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, the potential adopter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, or an animal friendly business. \r\n\r\nHome Visit- If after the meet and greet, the animal is determined to be the right match for the adopter, the adoption will then be listed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpending\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  A home visit will then be completed by a STAR volunteer.  This is a home visit to determine if the home is a safe place for the animal.  If a dog requires a fenced in yard, this will also be thoroughly checked at this time. \r\n\r\nFinalize Adoption- After the home visit is approved, the adoption can then be finalized.

Our adoption counselors will ask you many questions to determine which pet will do well in your home and which will not.

Since some of our pets have had serious medical conditions, we want to ensure that you have a commitment to provide the ongoing care they may need.\r\nPlease understand that we deal with homeless or unwanted animals. Many of our animals come from unknown backgrounds through local shelters. Most have medical or behavioral concerns that we have addressed as well as providing their well care. The adoption process may seem time consuming, but we wish to maximize an animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chance for a successful, permanent adoption. Adopting a companion pet is a major consideration and responsible pet ownership demands a considerable commitment.

We will go beyond just vet care and get these animals rehabilitated as needed using trainers and behaviorists to help overcome issues related to past trauma.\r\n\r\nIt is our belief that no injured or abused animal should lose its life simply due to lack of funds. We do not have our own shelter, and we will rely on volunteers, fosters and adopters to take the animals into their homes and provide them with proper care and nurturing.\r\n\r\nAll of our animals will be vaccinated, heartworm tested, micro-chipped and altered.

We do not transport our ACDs to their new homes. ","about":"About OCDRT\r\n\r\nPersimmonAustralian Cattle Dogs have always found themselves in shelters, as many people do not do proper research on the breed before acquiring an ACD. The need to have a network for them in Ohio is great. While Ohio Cattle Dog Rescue Team may be a newly formed group (mid 2014), this team has many combined years working together in rescue. The Founders of OCDRT have been active in ACD Rescue since 2003, along with backgrounds in the veterinary fields, animal control fields, business ownership fields, military fields; all have been through the adoption process with other Rescues.\r\n\r\nOCDRT takes in ACDs primarily from shelters. Owner surrenders are considered on a case by case basis if we have room. If you want to surrender your ACD, please contact us; maybe we can assist you with keeping your ACD in its own home first. After OCDRT takes in an ACD, OCDRT then completes all the vetting, does evaluations, does necessary training and when the ACD is ready, offers them for adoption to approved homes. ACDs who find themselves in the shelter may be there for any number of reasons and most often it is through no fault of their own. This breed is not for everyone; they are very cute as puppies, but when they start to herd \/ mouth \/ bark \/ ignore their person to do what pleases them (sometimes they are simply deaf), many people become overwhelmed and give the puppy away or surrender them to a shelter. These behaviors are all normal ACD behaviors; however, most people do not want to deal with the intelligence that comes along with this sometimes stubborn breed that will take over a home if allowed.\r\n\r\nOur fosters are normally older pups or young adults. We are often asked if the adult will bond with its new family and our answer is always \u2018YES!\u2019 This breed is very loyal and will typically pick one person in the family to shadow, but will interact with all in the family. When you adopt an adult, you skip all the \u2018unknowns\u2019 that come with a puppy. The adult\u2019s size, color, looks and temperament are known; a puppy is a blank slate. Breeding and how the pup is raised\/socialized will determine what kind of adult that puppy will become. If you still think you want a puppy, please know we do not adopt our puppies out until they are 16 weeks of age so we can have them altered \/ vaccinated and start a very strong foundation in socialization and training. ACDs need tremendous amounts of each and they will test you nearly every day.\r\n\r\nWe are a 501(c)3 and all donations are tax deductible! Donations go toward helping with OCDRT\u2019s food and \/ or vet expenses.","meetPets":"Our foster ACDs can be met in their foster homes after the adoption application has been approved.

We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.\r\nStep 1 \u0096 Complete Adoption Application The first step in the adoption process is filling out the application on our website. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, your home environment and your experience with pet ownership. We cannot accommodate an introduction with one of our dogs without this first step being completed.\r\nStep 2 \u0096 Application Preliminary Review Our application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information. Please allow 24 \u0096 48 hours for a volunteer to get back to you. After submitting your application, be sure to add allbreedvt@gmail.com to your contacts or check your spam folder. Most of our communication is done via e-mail.\r\nStep 3 \u0096 Landlord Approval Verified If it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations. If your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\nStep 4 \u0096 Veterinary References Contacted Our volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed\/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don\u0092t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped. We are happy to make recommendations if you are looking for a veterinarian. If your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay\/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be held until you can provide this information.\r\nStep 5 \u0096 Personal References Contacted Our volunteers will contact your personal references and ask them questions in regards to whether they consider you to be a responsible pet owner. This is the portion of the process that can take the most amount of time. It is helpful if you contact your references and ask them to return our calls in a timely manner. If our reference checking volunteers have any major concerns about adopting a dog to you, based on communication with your references, your application may be denied at this point in the process.\r\nStep 6 \u0096 Meeting between Approved Applicant & Available Dogs. Most of our dogs are currently boarding at a facility in South Burlington, however our organization is volunteer run. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our dogs until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process. Once you have been approved, a volunteer will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. Just because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. All adoptions are first come, first served and we cannot \u0093hold\u0094 a dog based on interest alone. Our priority is placing dogs in loving homes. If you fall in love at the time of your meeting but are not ready to bring the dog home with you, a dog can be reserved for three days with a non-refundable deposit of $150. This deposit will be applied to the total adoption fee when the adoption is finalized.\r\nStep 7 \u0096 Finalizing The Adoption Once you have decided on the dog a volunteer will proceed with paperwork. This includes reviewing and signing an adoption agreement, vet services form, and transfer of all ownership and vetting that we have on the dog. Adoption fees must be paid by cash, money order, or bank check only. Please note, as we rescue the majority of our dogs from high-kill Southern shelters we do not know a lot about the dog\u0092s history, genetics, age, or behaviors. We are able to share information we gather based on what we learn of our dogs during their time with us and in foster homes and based on their wellness exams by veterinarians.\r\nStep 8 \u0096 Trip to the Vet It is recommended that you make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible after adopting a dog from our program. While every effort is made to provide the best possible care once these dogs come to us, we cannot guarantee their health. Although all of our dogs have had their basic vaccines and are dewormed monthly, some clinical signs of viruses do not show up prior to adoption. Additionally, if, at the time of adoption, your dog was not already spayed\/neutered, you would have been required to sign a spay\/neuter agreement. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed\/neutered within one month of adoption or when age appropriate. You are asked to notify us when and by who this surgery will be will be performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed\/neutered. If you fail to spay\/neuter, as outlined in the adoption contract you signed, our organization will take appropriate measures to take back the dog\r\nStep 9 \u0096 Optional Post Adoption Follow-up Visit Our adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. All Breed Rescue is committed to the life, health and well-being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dog\u0092s life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome the dog, we require, by contract, that the dog be returned to us.performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed\/neutered.

We vaccinate, microchip, spay\/neuter, and treat heartworms before the dogs are placed in new homes. Only dogs of stable temperament and reasonable health are placed through our program. We maintain vet records and keep the dogs current on a regimen of heartworm preventative while they are in our program. We look for the right home for each dog. Matches are made based upon the needs of the individual adoptive homes and the temperament of the dog.\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\nWe believe there is a real need for breed education. There are many reasons Doberman Pinschers end up in shelters, become stray or abandoned. We seek to make the general public aware that Doberman Pinschers are companion animals; not guard dogs to be left in a yard. We inform people of the importance of proper socialization, the need for training for a dog of any age, and the activity requirements of a working breed.\r\nHADR is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.

This county has no Animal Shelter and no Animal Control.  For 8+  years we have worked hard to encourage the County Mayor & Commissions to get an Animal Shelter in place.  Since there is no state mandate to do such a thing, the county officials will not take responsibility for the stray & unwanted animals, citing monetary reasons.  Our county does grant us $4,000 a year, but this amount is only 7% of our annual financial need.  \r\n\r\nSo every single unclaimed stray, abandoned (and there are many), and\/or injured animals relies on our very small group for life-saving assistance.  We are often over-whelmed in attempting to take in as many of these neglected animals as possible.  Generally, we take in approximately 250+\/- unwanted or injured or sickly animals each year.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have 45 volunteers\/members on our rolls, only a handful (3 or 4) can foster these animals in their homes.   Most of us also have full time jobs.  Although vet expenses for all these animals are covered through donations & grants, the foster parents cover the food & treat expenses.  Also, each foster transports their adoptable pets to our nearest local city (Clarksville, TN) every single Sunday (without fail) to Petsmart Adoption Events from 11 to 4.  This transport is a 60+ mile round-trip for each foster parent.  The cost of transporting the animals is also paid for by the foster parents.\r\n","meetPets":"Every Sunday\r\nPetsmart, Clarksville, Tn\r\n11 to 4\r\n","services":"Adoption of fully vetted dogs and cats","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Most often you will need to drive to the area of the foster home, but if we can arrange transportation to you to meet the pup, we will do our best.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We will discuss with you how the meet & greet went.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Once approved to adopt a particular pup, we will contact you with the news. You then have 24-48 hrs to discuss it with your family. You must then contact an NELR rep within this 24-48 hr timeframe if you do decide to adopt. This is very important as the details of arranging transport of the rescued dog will need to be made, often times we have several people involved in this process and we need to plan around multiple schedules. If we do not hear from you in this 24-48 hr time period, we will assume you have changed your mind, your application will be voided, and we will move on to other applicants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We will then work with you to either pick up your new pup, or arrange transportation to get the pup to you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n** Lastly, you will sign our adoption contract and the adoption fee will be required upon your taking ownership of the pup.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThings to Remember:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Our goal is to find the best match based on the Lab\u0092s background and the family\u0092s needs. The temperament and energy level of the dog are our most important consideration. We consider factors in the home, including the ages of the children, ages of pets in the home and what type of other pets are in your home. We never base our adoption process on who gets their application in first, instead we weigh all applications to find the best suited family for the pup's needs based on our assessments of our dogs. Our number one goal is to be 100% committed to every dog we rescue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**If you apply for a certain dog, we will do our best to see if that particular pup is a good fit, but there are times when, for many different reasons, that it might not be a good match. That does not mean there is anything wrong with your application, just that that particular dog requires different needs. Should you not be applying for a specific dog, the Adoption Coordinator will talk with you about which dogs best fit your home and lifestyle.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Please understand that although filling out an application is the first step in the process, filling out the application in and of itself does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt a particular pup...again many different factors go into our decisions, and our number one goal is to find the best suited family for that dog, with the goal being that none of our rescue dogs ever find themselves homeless again. Also please do not fill out an application and share with your children that you are adopting that particular dog, as it is not a guarantee until you receive confirmation from the Adoption Coordinator that you are approved to adopt a particular rescued dog. NELR does reserve the right to deny any application for any reason.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**At the time of adoption, we will provide you with copies of the Lab\u0092s medical history and any information from the previous owner if available.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**The adoption donation for a Rescue Lab is $350. For Labs under the age of 1 year, the Adoption donation is $375. For seniors over 7 yrs of age there is a reduced adoption donation of between $100-$200. Full payment is required at the time of adoption. This is an all volunteer organization, so all adoption fees and donations go right back into rescuing more labs in urgent need!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Families with children 10 years old or younger must have a fenced-in area.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We do not place Labs in families with children unless we know the dog has a positive\r\n\r\n experience with children.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We do not place Rescue Labs with families that run a home-based childcare or doggie\r\n\r\n daycare program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**All current dogs in an applicant's home must be up-to-date on all vaccines, including the Bordetella vaccine (kennel cough.) They also must be treated monthly with Heartgard or a similar heartworm preventative.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Finally please understand that all of us put many hours into helping NELR each week, but we are all volunteers, with our own families, jobs, our own dogs, often times foster dogs, etc...We work very hard at saving these beautiful labs, but we can't always make everyone happy with our placement choices. If a dog you were interested in is ultimately placed with a different adoptive family, please do not take it personally. Again it does not mean that there was anything wrong with your application, more that it wasn't the right placement for the dog. We always have other beautiful labs available for adoption, which we will be happy to discuss with you and might be just perfect for your family.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPost Adoption\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**First and Foremost, please remember that all rescue pups need to be given a period of time to adjust to their new home, bond with their new family, and possibly relearn some manners. They may have already proven to be successful with house training for example, but once again are in a new place and are now confused & possibly scared until they settle in. They don\u0092t arrive at a new home knowing which door they should use to go out, who to alert to, etc...they need to be trained with the new house rules and to learn what is and isn\u0092t allowed. These pups have been through a lot, and need lots of love, consistency and set boundaries. Some rescue pups walk into their new homes and it is like they have always been there, others may take a few weeks to a few months to really settle in.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Volunteers will be available to help you with problems and concerns, and to answer\r\n\r\n any questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**If, for any reason, the adoption is not satisfactory, the Lab must be returned to NELR as stated in the Adoption Agreement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**New England Lab Rescue reserves the right to take possession of a Rescue Lab that is\r\n\r\n neglected, improperly cared for, develops a serious temperament problem, or is allowed to run loose.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank You for Considering New England Lab Rescue.","about":"New England Lab Rescue was founded in 2010 by Heather Labbe'. When she saw the number of Labs showing up in shelters steadily increase, Heather decided to step up and make a difference.\r\n\r\nNew England is a region of the country with a high demand for Labrador Retrievers, resulting in very few found in local shelters. Heather realized that with funding and a lot of hard work, she could rescue animals from shelters in southern states and bring them to New England for adoption.\r\n\r\nTo date, NELR has helped over 200 Labs find their fur-ever families.\r\n\r\nNELR expects to have 501c3 status in 2011 and hopes to see an increase in funding at that time, which means more Labs can be rescued!\r\n\r\nIf you cannot adopt or foster a Lab but would like to help us with our efforts, please contact us to find out how you can get involved!\r\n","meetPets":"We try to schedule meet and greets once applicants are approved, but locations do not always match up","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We don't \"force\" a dog on you but we help you pick a dog that is going to fit your needs. The adoption fee of $ 225.00 covers: Spay\/Neuter, Teeth Cleaning, Shots Updated, 3 months supply of Heart-worm Preventative, Martingale Style Collar (specially designed for Greyhounds), Leash, and of course a Greyhound. Along with this, you will also have access to a large Greyhound community where Greyhound owners pride themselves with their knowledge and love of this wonderful breed.\r\n\r\n","about":"Allies for Greyhounds of West Michigan retrieves Greyhounds bred for racing.

All dogs who visit our shelter must be on a leash and be up to date on all vaccinations.\r\n\r\nAdoption is a lifetime commitment including the training, emotional commitment and future medical care. Our most successful adoptions are to visitors who take their time in finding an appropriate companion.

We very much encourage fostering an animal first before actually adopting. Please ask us about our fostering procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdoptions are held at the shelter, 11901 S.

","about":"The Amarillo SPCA is a 501(c)3 non profit organization. We operate solely on donations and fundraisers.\r\n\r\nWe operate a shelter for dogs and cats and have approximately 140 animals, most of which are housed at the shelter.  A few live temporarily in foster homes.\r\n\r\nOne of our main concerns as an organization is pet over population. It is important that the public be educated about the importance of spaying and neutering their pets. It is also our goal to make sure every animal that is adopted from the SPCA is sterilized before going to a new home.\r\n\r\nWe receive calls daily from people who request help with their animals--either needing to give them up or asking for help with food and medical needs. We help whenever we can.  Our kennels are full most of the time but we will try our hardest to accommodate any animal that is homeless or needing a home.  Because of our own expenses, we rarely are able to help the public with pet care costs. We do provide spay and neuter vouchers for a significantly reduced fee. We also provide microchipping services to the general public for a reduced fee.\r\n\r\nWe have grown to the extent that volunteers alone cannot provide necessary hours for operating the kennels. We have a shelter manager and part time employees along with volunteers who work hard maintaining the shelter.\r\n\r\nMany animals we bring into the shelter need immediate medical care, and all animals that come to us receive their shots, a microchip and sterilization before being adopted into their new homes. Frequently these expenses are far more than the adoption fee of $100. It is our duty to provide the best medical treatment possible regardless of cost for our animals--and therefore our vet bills are always very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have created this website to provide accessible information concerning all of the animal related organizations and events that are occuring in the Texas Panhandle as well as a resource base for those seeking advice or care for their pets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, we invite anyone who is affiliated with a particular animal welfare organization, specialized pet-owner group (such as pet therapy or obedience training,) or any business that is in the service of animals (veterinarians, groomers, pet sitters, etc.) to contact us so that we may tell the public about your organization or business. We do, however, respectfully decline to list any breeders or to promote breeding services as it is not in alignment with our mission of curbing the pet overpopulation crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amarillo SPCA","meetPets":"Dogs and cats are available for adoption at our shelter Tuesday through Saturday, 12-5 p.m..

CCS is a nonprofit organization and was established in order to improve the quality of life for homeless, injured and abused cats in the Denver metropolitan area. The Society's goals are:\r\n\r\nTo sponsor educational programs that promote responsible pet ownership, humane treatment of all animals, and the elimination of pet overpopulation;\r\nTo shelter cats in a healthy, cage free environment and to find compatible and responsible families for every cat;\r\nTo provide community outreach programs that improve the quality of life for cats and people;\r\nTo be a friend to all cats.\r\n\r\nThe shelter provides a temporary refuge for more than 50 cats until an appropriate and permanent home can be found for each. Veterinary care, premium diet and human interaction are lovingly provided.\r\n\r\nThe large number of phone calls received each day from people who have found abandoned, abused or injured cats needing good homes indicates a strong community need for our services.  We receive an average of 70 phone calls for assistance daily.  Sadly, more than half of these are from owners needing to give up their cats.  For these cats, we provide Information about placing the cat and referrals to other area shelters.   We also provide this same information to people who have found a cat when we are at or over our capacity and cannot take the cat.  Many calls involve behavioral problems or are questions about feral (wild) cats.  Behavior counseling and printed articles on a wide variety of topics are available at the shelter.  \r\n\r\nCat Care Society is supported by a number of loyal members and contributors, without whom we could not operate. We receive no government funding. In addition, our volunteers assist with many fundraising activities each year such as our Tails of the Painted Cats Gala Dinner & Auction, Meow Mart, Paws On The Green Charity Golf Tournament, Santa Paws Festival, Colorado Gives Day, and much more. \r\n\r\nWe offer these these programs for our donors:\r\n\r\nNine Lives Legacy Society\r\nNine Lives Cat Guardianship Program\r\nNine Lives Partners Giving Club\r\n\r\nCCS respects the privacy of our donors.

Establish a site to provide safe haven; a place for secure intake of rescued dogs where love is given as each dog's specific needs are identified and care is given as work is done to find each dog a \"forever home\".\r\nII. Secure a place for Millington Animal Safe Haven's rescued dogs, volunteer workers and prospective families to come together. A place where life is positive, uplifting and fun. A comfortable environment for people and dogs to play, meet and greet.\r\nIII. M.A.S.H. will work to raise public awareness by communications, fundraising, public functions, adoption days and working in coordination with other local groups in the City of Millington and the surrounding areas to advance the needs of dogs identified by this mission. We will focus on providing humane treatment and \"forever\" homes for the rescued dogs in need.

","about":"Good Dog Rescue is a an all-breed rescue group headquartered in Enfield CT. Our group is comprised of volunteers all over Eastern United States who love dogs and want to help those that end up homeless through no fault of their own. Loyal and loving dogs turn up every day in Southern shelters, as owners turn them in or they\u2019re found roaming the streets after being dumped. To the best of our abilities, we evaluate all of our Good Dogs\u2019 temperament and suitability for living with other dogs, cats, and children. A dog\u2019s health is checked, and we make sure they are up-to-date on all shots and are spayed or neutered. Then, we place them in loving foster homes until they find their very own family. Our goal is to meet the needs of each dog as an individual and to assure proper placement in a loving forever home.  \r\nWhat We Do...  Good Dog is dedicated to animal rescue. In addition to our primary goal of helping homeless and abandoned dogs, we \r\n- donate money to low-cost spay\/neuter clinics in the south to help solve the problem of pet overpopulation; \r\n- engage in community outreach activities with local schools to help educate children and young adults about animal rescue and responsible pet ownership; \r\n- team with non-profit organizations that train rescued dogs to assist disabled people. More than a dozen of our Good Dogs have become certified service dogs, helping disabled people lead more independent lives. \r\n  \r\nWe are proud of the work we do with our good dogs and in our local communities. \r\n\r\nSouth to North Connection\r\nEvery month, dozens of our Southern Good Dogs ride the transport north to their new forever and foster homes. The USDA-licensed transport drives up every week to meet new forever and foster families at various locations along the Tennessee-New England route. Our Southern adoptions are long-distance and the dogs are taken directly home from the transport . We facilitate  long-distance adoptions by the transfer of pictures and information about the dog, and we arrange to have the adopter speak to the dog's foster parents. When a dog is in a New England foster home, we are more than happy to arrange a pre-adoption meeting!

Once an animal is placed from our rescue, the animal cannot be sold, given away or otherwise transferred. If the adopter is, at any time, unable to keep or continue to maintain the animal for any reason, the animal must be returned to the St. Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Animal Welfare League. \r\n\r\nWe work hard at matching our animals to adopters, so they may end their search for a loving, permanent home. Temperament, special needs and personality are all factors in our placements. \r\nStep #1 \r\nThe Adoption Application \r\nThe initial step in our adoption process is the Adoption Application. This can either be done online or in person. The Adoption form must be filled out completely including vet references and two personal non-family references. Your application will be reviewed and your references will be contacted. We contact your veterinarian to ensure that your current or recently deceased pets were properly taken care of---this means being current on all vaccinations and spayed or neutered. In order to speed up the process, please contact your veterinarian and let them know to expect our call. \r\nStep #2\r\nPersonal Interview You will be interviewed by a SMAWL Board Member or Volunteer either through phone, email or in person. This is an opportunity to learn more specifics about you, your family, your pets and the type of pet you are looking for. At this time, we may suggest that you consider a different animal---one that we may feel might be more acceptable for your situation. If you are completing your application in person, this will most likely be done at that time of completion.\r\nStep #3\r\nThe Home Visit If all goes well with the application verification, we will schedule a home visit. A home visit is required to ensure that your home is everything you say it is on the Adoption Application. It needs to be a suitable safe environment for your new pet. All pets and family members should be home at this time.\r\nStep #4\r\nMeeting Your Potential Adoptee Once the Application has been reviewed and all references checked, arrangements will be made for you to meet with the animal you wish to adopt, either through the foster parent or the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Case Manager. As a courtesy to our foster families, we do not ask them to show their animals to individuals until we have completed the application approval process. If you have other animals, we recommend a neutral meeting place, such as PETCO or a local park to ensure the animals are compatible outside of their own territory.\r\nStep #5\r\nFinalizing The Adoption Once the adoption has been approved, we will contact you to finalize the adoption. You will need to sign the contract and pay our adoption fee. (Dogs=$200, Young Cats 2 years and under =$125, Older Cats over 2 years = $75) \r\nFoster to adopt over a two week period may be available on a case by case basis.\r\nAny applications received for adoptions from beyond St Mary's county line, will be subject to additional terms and conditions available on request.\r\nPlease Remember: Our entire organization is staffed by volunteers. We have NO paid staff. Our volunteers must work your application around their business and personal lives. It may take as long as one week for you to hear from someone, but typically most applications are approved within 7-10 days.

We also serve as a resource to our community and all pet owners by providing education and information on responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spay\/neuter, positive behavior training, and good nutrition.\r\n\r\nNo board members or employees at CARE Pet Rescue are paid a salary. Their time with the rescue, whether it be in an administrative role or working directly with the animals, is volunteer only.\r\n\r\nWith shelters at their maximum capacity a lot of times, rescues are necessary in all communities. Rescuing and being able to home deserving pets into foster homes, and not in noisy kennels, feels really good. All pets deserve what we can give our rescue pets. ","meetPets":"Most of our pets are being fostered in the Des Moines area. All of our fosters have agreed to allow people to come to their homes, by appointment, to visit with the available pets. We do meetings at parks, or pet food stores, and even at the adopters' homes, quite often. \r\nOur volunteers and fosters allow for visits or meetings any day of the week, including weekends.

We look forward to helping you find your next forever family member! Check out all of our adoptable animals HERE. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the process for adopting an animal?  \r\n\r\nThe steps are briefly outlined below: \r\n\r\n* Before potential adopters can physically meet a foster animal outside of our open adoption events, we require them to fill out an adoption application. Check out our scheduled adoption events HERE. \r\n\r\n* After applications are reviewed, suitable applicants are contacted to set up a Pre-Adoption Meeting with our volunteers and we often include the foster parent of the animal you would like to adopt. This meeting is designed to answer any questions adopters may have about a particular animal or our adoption process. \r\n\r\n* Once your application is approved, meet and greets with the foster animal and foster parents will be scheduled with qualified applicants if this has not already occurred. \r\n\r\n* After the meet and greet (and if the applicant is still interested in the animal), foster parents will make a recommendation to shelter staff regarding the adoption. The foster animal stays with the foster parent until they hear from the Diamond In The Ruff adoption committee. \r\n\r\n* Adoption is approved or rejected by the Diamond In The Ruff Adoption Committee. Final approval of all adoptions is at the sole discretion of Diamond in the Ruff. \r\n\r\n* Once approved, another meeting will be arranged between the foster parent and adopter wherein the adoption fee is collected and contracts are signed. The foster animal then goes to its new forever home*.  *Final placements are pending results of week-long trial period. Check out some of our amazing success stories HERE!  \r\n\r\n* A Diamond in the Ruff volunteer will contact you after 72 hours to see how everyone is settling in as well as answer any questions you may have.   \r\n\r\n* After your week trial period is up, we will deposit your adoption fee and distribute your animals vet records and microchip information in a timely fashion.  \r\n\r\n* Please keep in mind, we are a 100% volunteer run organization and we will process your applications as fast as we can. If you have any questions about your application, contact our Application Coordinator at _____________________.

Dogs XL operates like a social networking service for dogs, designed to match people and pets based on the principles of compatibility and compassion. \r\n\r\nAs the name implies, Dogs XL specializes in finding homes for large dogs (typically 75lbs+). Large dogs are often first to be put to sleep in shelters because medical treatment and food for large dogs is more expensive than for small dog. Large dogs also take up more space at the shelter and on transports to adoptive families. Although owning a large dog is not for everyone, large dogs have many unique and endearing qualities. Here at Dogs XL, we believe the larger the dog, the more there is to love. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, Dogs XL will intervene on behalf of a smaller dog with an XL personality.

CHANGE is a state and federally accredited non-profit organization. It is not a county agency and is supported entirely by private donations.\r\n\r\nCHANGE provides 24\/7 emergency transportation and foster care to horses in the custody of local law enforcement. All horses in the program receive complete veterinary care, hoof care, specialized nutritional support, and their own set of care supplies made possible by generous community donations to the CHANGE Tack and Supply Donation Program. Once rehabilitated, horses are then adopted by permanent loving families\r\n\r\nCHANGE also serves the community through education and outreach events such as law enforcement training seminars on equine-related subjects and low-cost castration clinics for the public. CHANGE also has served as a subsidiary in several courtroom cases by providing expert witness testimony. Some of the cases set legal precedent and garnered national media attention. \r\n\r\nVision Statement\r\n To improve the acceptable standard of care for horses by being an agency of social change.\r\n\r\nMission Statement\r\n To support local law enforcement as a subsidiary in equine cases through humane education, logistical and financial avenues.\r\n\r\nCore Values\r\n    \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Transparency\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Accountability\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Professionalism\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Support of law enforcement\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Education\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Advocacy for horses\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Ethical leadership\r\n   \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Service to the community through a novel approach\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n To be a transformative agency; to reach beyond business as usual\r\n To be a sustainable and secure organization\r\n\r\nIn a county with more than 20,000 horses, resources for horses in law enforcement custody have at times been hard to come by. The unique housing, handling and management needs of horses make them a logistical challenge for municipalities, especially in light of tough economic times. But in 2007, horses in critical need found themselves with more options and a chance at a better future thanks to the inception of the 501(c)3 organization Coins to Help Abandoned and Neglected Equines (CHANGE). CHANGE functions as a community-based support network that assists local law enforcement with equine humane cases. \r\n\r\n CHANGE provides housing, veterinary care, farrier care and adoption services for horses in law enforcement custody. Since the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inception, it has assisted with several dozen critical horses, many of whom entered the foster care program near death but were successfully rehabilitated and adopted into loving homes. But CHANGE doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop there--it also strives to educate law enforcement and the community about horse care. Through its efforts, CHANGE has helped to set legal precedent by providing expert witness testimony in several equine criminal cases. \r\n\r\n According to equine veterinarian Grant Miller, simply caring for horses who are victims of abuse and abandonment without addressing the root of the issue \u00e2\u0080\u009cenables the problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miller, who founded CHANGE after euthanizing an emaciated and severely dehydrated horse left tied to a fence in 100-degree heat, describes a multi-pronged approach to the challenge of horse neglect. It all starts, and ends, with the law. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe law is the bottom line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Miller, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if you enforce the law, you pull the situation up by the bootstraps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \r\n\r\nCHANGE recognizes that prevention of horse abuse and neglect before it occurs is preferable to prosecuting and punishing offenders. That is why CHANGE works to offer education programs to law enforcement and the public in order to create a better understanding of basic horse care and handling. \r\n\r\n It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tall order for a little organization that subsists solely on donations from the community, but CHANGE is showing Sonoma County that big changes can come from the collective efforts of the community. \"We are taking a new approach to an old problem,\" says Miller. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \r\n\r\nThe ongoing success of CHANGE is due to the overwhelming community support that it has received. It is clear that concerned community members want a method to contribute in whatever way they are able. When people see a horse in distress, they do not want to feel helpless. CHANGE gives them the tools they need to become empowered and to make their neighborhood a healthy place, for animals and people. Please donate today to help make a difference in the life of a horse in need and in your community. ","meetPets":"By appointment only.

Our founders realized that the only way to help control the cat population was to spay and neuter as many free roaming animals as possible.  Thus, our Spay\/Neuter program was formed with local veternarians.  And from this program, our adoption program was born.\r\nWe continue doing this for our love of the animals and to educate the public about the importance of spay\/neuter.  We also love to find loving homes for our adoptables.","meetPets":"Our foster parents show their animals at various venues in the area, such as Petco, Pet Supermarket, PetSmart and at various adoption events and festivals.","services":"Adoptions; Spay\/Neuter; Education; Advocacy","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We rescue almost all types of dogs including bully breeds and we make it a point to provide appropriate veterinary care as well as proper socialization.

We honor a little Boston Terrier named Dexter who was given a second chance. \r\n\r\nThe Dexter Foundation is dedicated to helping shelter dogs and other rescue organizations who adopt misunderstood dogs. We assist owners needing to find homes for their dogs by posting their dogs, screening applicants, and finding them new loving forever homes. We work cooperatively with other rescues and help fund the rescue and care of shelter dogs. We provide a safe haven for abandoned dogs that are passed over. In these difficult economic times, many owners are forced to surrender or abandon their dogs who may need only temporary medical attention. The Dexter Foundation, with your assistance, is able to help save the lives of these otherwise happy, healthy dogs. \r\n\r\nLittle Dexter sat at the San Diego shelter, abandoned by the only person he knew. His owner was no longer able to care for him and turned him over to someone he trusted to care and find a home for him. Instead, the person called animal control on him. Dexter was so frightened, he bit the animal control officer and was scheduled to be euthanized as he was then deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009caggressive\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the shelter, and would not be adopted to the public. Thankfully, he was rescued by a group willing to take on dogs with behavioral problems and understood that a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior in a shelter is not indicative of a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true behavior. \r\n\r\nDexter had spent the first few years of his life knowing only one person, never having been taken outside to meet other dogs or new people. When that owner could no longer care for him, he was turned out into an unknown world. After two failed placements while he was learning how to play with other dogs and people, he was sent to live with the President of the rescue group who fell in love with him and his lively personality. \r\n\r\nDexter now lives with two rescued brothers, Blue and Scout, and a rescued sister named Annabelle. All were adopted from shelters throughout Southern California. Annabelle and Scout both would have been euthanized if not adopted by rescue due to the fear they exhibited with new people. They have all learned to how to be part of a family and made many new friends. They provide their new family with lots of love. \r\n\r\nDexter, and all dogs like him, are grateful to the many rescue groups who have given them a second chance. The Dexter Foundation asks for your support so that we can provide funding and support to the dogs and rescue groups willing to give the misunderstood dogs a second chance. \r\n","meetPets":"Contact us and we can arrange to meet at the home of the foster parents or your home.

By working closely with local animal shelters, we hope to prevent the senseless euthanasia of these unfortunate stray or abandoned pets, which have ended up in shelters through no fault of their own.\r\nAfter providing incoming dogs with immediate medical care, vaccinations, heartworm testing, and spay\/neuter, rescued dogs are brought into temporary foster care where they receive the same love and attention as a cherished family pet. Through temperament evaluation, and behavioral modification as needed, we endeavor to insure that each homeless dog finds a loving family and will \"come home to stay.\" \r\nWe educate the public and potential adopters about spay\/neuter, vaccinations, heartworm preventatives, regular vet care, good nutrition, regular grooming, microchipping, and just as importantly, \"adopting\" rather than purchasing from a breeder. By continuing to educate, and constantly searching for caring foster homes, the volunteers of DFW Tzus & More Rescue hope to realize our dream of a day when we are able to rescue and rehome every Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, and all their other small, furry friends in DFW Metroplex shelters.","meetPets":"PetSmart - N.

Because of him, we have been rescuing dogs for many years. When he got to high school, he was able to work part time through vocational training at school. His first job at a vet clinic didn't satisfy him very well because he only got to clean and not interact with the animals. We found a wonderful place for him to work called Woodland West Animal Hospital. They allowed him to work through vocational training and he got to work with the animals! Boy did he ever flourish!\r\n\r\n They fostered his love of animals so much that he was the first student at his high school to start an animal rescue club. He got students involved in volunteering and helping local animal rescues. That was only the beginning for Spencer.\r\n\r\n He got involved with the Oklahoma Alliance for Animals in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They took him under their wings and he flourished again. He got involved in adoption events, helping animals that had been affected by wildfires and tornadoes. He also helped spread the word about spaying and neutering.\r\n\r\n Needless to say, as his parents we are very proud of the young man that Spencer has become. His life mission is to make sure that all animals have a loving and forever home.\r\n\r\n One particular rescue found a permanent dwelling place in Spencer's heart. That dog was named Bubba. Spencer and Bubba have been inseparable. Spencer thinks that the sun rises and sets in Bubba. When we started helping to achieve his dream of having his own rescue, we asked him what did he want to call it. Of course, he said \"Bubba's Rescue\". When we asked him what his mission was for Bubba's Rescue, he said that he wanted to make sure that all animals had a home and that he wouldn't have to rescue any more","meetPets":"They can visit by appointment at 30423 Weeks Road, Waldron, AR.

After many months of planning and preparation, launched Royalty Dog Rescue, LLC on April 26th, 2013.  We are an all volunteer res- cue groups, located in beautiful Tuscarawas County, Ohio. We began as a small group formed to help save dogs in need, and have grown to over 20 fosters and almost 15 volunteers.  We do not have a facility - our pets for adoption are fostered, providing them with a sense of a home life while they wait for their forever home. We work with other rescues in the area by taking in some dogs when they are filled to capacity. Founded by dog lovers, who combined have over 40 years of rescue experience. We have thoroughly screened foster par- ents for the dogs in our program.       Our mission statement is, Royalty Dog Rescue saves dogs who have run out of time at dog pounds and brings people and animals together to enrich each others lives. Our goals include the rescue, rehabilitation, spay\/neuter and adoption of the abandoned dogs, as well public education regarding breeds and the im- portance of spay\/neuter of animals in battling the escalating overpopulation problem.    Royalty Dog Rescue, take dogs into our program from dog pounds, humane societies, surrendered by owners and from commercial breeders. We will never pay an individual or breeder for a dog.  All dogs are spayed\/neutered and receive complete vet care, before they can be adopted.

Please make sure and let your vet know that we will be calling and give them permission to speak to us! Remember, we are a small all volunteer rescue, so it may sometimes take a week or two once we receive your application to call them. Please be patient with us during this process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The second step is that we arrange a meet and greet with the dog or dogs that you are interested in. Our adoption procedure includes having several meet and greet with our prince or princesses, along with their foster parents before an adoption is finalized. If you are willing to commit to these visits, we are more than willing to adopt to you and your family. Adopting a rescue dog is a long term commitment .We are not a facility, all of our dogs are in foster homes. The meet and greet will be held at one of our board members home. If you currently have pets in your home, you are more than welcome to bring them to this meeting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The third step in the process is that we will arrange for a home visit. We will bring the dog or dogs that you are interested to your home. \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The final step in the process is that the Royalty Dog Rescue Board members will meet and decide which kingdom is the best fit for our Royal and then the adoption will be finalized. We do require that you come to us for your final adoption also. \r\n\r\nSome important things to note:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2It may take a week or two to arrange a meet and greet due to the foster families schedule. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Our policy is NOT first come first serve, it is whomever is the best fit for the dog and sometimes the dog chooses for us! \u200b\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2If a home visit is done more than 60 miles from Dover, Ohio, a $25.00 mileage fee will be added for each 60 miles, to the adoption donation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2YES!!

Be specific in your answers to give us the best possible picture of your home and family. A volunteer will review your application and get back to you within five days. Due to the high volume of adoption applications, we use email to communicate initially during the screening process. Please remember to check your email for our response, and if you do not receive a reply to your application within five days, please email us.\r\n\r\nSometimes we may have concerns regarding an application, and we reserve the right to deny an application if we feel there is a reason the home would not be appropriate for one of our Keeshond rescue dogs. If we will not be proceeding with your application, we will do our best to communicate this in a timely fashion. We receive many applications online each day, and we usually have several persons interested in a particular Keeshond rescue dog. We closely review each application, looking at the family's lifestyle, how much time they spend at home, yard size, current pets in the household, their previous pet history and their knowledge of dogs. We compare this to what we feel would be the best environment for the dog, considering his or her training and exercise needs, any medical needs, how the dog relates to children and other animals, etc. After considering each application, we choose the one that seems to be the best match for the dog. If your application is not chosen for the dog you are initially interested in, we suggest you visit our web site often, and email us if there is a different dog you think would be a good fit for your family.\r\n \r\n# A home visit is required for approval of an application and will be done prior to adoption. The volunteer visiting your home will check your fence and gates for security, and will make sure that there aren't any safety hazards or other concerns within the home. In addition, we want to make sure that each member of the household agrees to the adoption and that any current pets in the home are well cared for. Adoption fees range from $250 to $400 for a Keeshond dog.","about":"  The primary purpose of Southern California Keeshond Rescue, Inc. is to rescue homeless Keeshond dogs, provide the dogs with safe, temporary foster care, and find new permanent homes for them with responsible, qualified owners.

It had recently stormed and caused flooding which made the shelter look more like a mud pit than a safe haven for homeless animals. While there we saw broken spirits and despair in the eyes of the animals. With the severe overcrowding, many dogs were in crates that were stacked on other crates. It was, at this time, we knew we need to help in any way we possible so we started fostering for the local shelter.\r\n             Our first foster was Raphael. He had sat at the shelter in those cold nights in the winter and extreme heat in the summer for over a year. He watched kennelmate after kennelmate leave on their freedom rides and find loving families while he was being looked over. He was an elderly senior shepard that had bad hips and needed a place to sleep while he healed from surgery. Finally, a rescue had stepped up and decided to save his life and we opened our home and hearts to Raphael. We took him to the vet and we gave him his medicine and we gave him a nickname. He had become our RaRa. He slept at our feet and he loved to lay in the sunshine. Soon the vet gave us the news that he was too sick to get his hips fixed and was becoming too sick to continue fighting. No matter how much we loved him, his stay at the shelter had taken his toll on him.\r\n             After we held RaRa in our arms for the last time and watched as he faded away, we knew in our hearts that we had to help animals like him get out of the shelter and into their second chances. It was all to often that pets would be brought in and watch as their owners left them there to become depressed and slowly fade. RaRa was our sign that we were meant to be the voice of those animals lost or abandoned.\r\n             Ever since we had to let our first foster go, we have been dedicated to those animals. RaRa may have crossed the Rainbow Bridge but he left his paw prints on our hearts that made us into the rescuers we are today and we are grateful to have had him in our lives!  \r\n\r\n","meetPets":"We are still foster based at the moment so a scheduled visit at a local park is usually what we do.","services":"Adoptions and Community Low cost Spay\/Neuter","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Our President is a retired Air Force Colonel who was a nurse. She and others saw a real need in this rural community for someone to help educate the people on how to better care for animals and the need to spay and neuter and decided to build a shelter and start housing the unwanted animals of Stone County. I have been actively involved since 2008. Our shelter dream was finally a reality when we were given a wonderful gift from a local person who died and left an estate trust to us that will be disbursed over a 12 year period. We were able to secure a bank loan to build the shelter based on the annual disbursements from this estate trust and it was completed in August. We believe that all animals should be properly cared for and loved and not tied up in a yard or left out in weather with not shelter or used for breeding. We have conducted several small size rescues in the area over the years with the help of the local authorities and helped stop one hoarder who had 200 dogs at one time and could not care for them. The ASPCA was called in to help with this issue. We can only house about 20 t o 25 dogs and the same number of cats at any one time. We do not have a viable foster program to help take in more unwanted animals. We work from a wait list and take animals that are in danger sooner than ones that are being cared for by someone. Last year in 2016 we adopted out 128 dogs and transported 37 dogs to another rescue in Colorado that we work with that takes our dogs or puppies that we do not have room to keep. This shelter has a facility as well as a large foster program to house the dogs till they are adopted out by them. We took in a total of 170 dogs and returned 38 to owners who had lost dogs. We adopted out 59 cats, had 68 cats surrendered and spayed and neutered 249 animals.

I personally got involved in rescue after purchasing a pomeranian from someone i thought was a \"reputable breeder\" in 2005.  This was before i was educated on puppy mills\/dog brokers, etc.   My pom passed away at age 6 to a auto immune disease.   During his illness i began researching the \"breeder\" and discovered she was a dog broker for a ohio amish puppy mill.   I was inspired to raise awareness and get involved in rescue.  \r\nI began by networking senior poms in kill shelters all over the country with my friend, Kit.  We would reach out to rescues and make them aware of dogs in need,  raise pledges to assist rescues with needed vetting, and arrange pull and transport assistance.  We started a page on Facebook named \"Saving Senior Poms, Inspired by Chance\" to assist with building supporters for our cause.   Chance was our first official save,  he was in a southern CA shelter and saved from death row. \r\nWe had a lot of supporters but few rescues willing to step up and help the senior dogs so i decided i couldn't sit back and watch these dogs die!  I started COPR to save seniors never expecting we would grow to the point we have now.  \r\n \r\nI work long hours arranging rescues, transports and insuring all needed vetting is done on each dog that we save.    I answer emails, screen applications, and arrange home visits for potential adopters.  I also foster, my personal favorites being fear aggressive and long term seniors. \r\n\r\nWe have a wonderful group of volunteers and fosters that continues to grow all the time!   I do what i do for the love of the dogs.  Watching them come out of their shell and learn to trust is such a inspiration.   Seeing a once fearful, abused dog in a loving forever home makes all the hard work and long hours worth every minute!

The sad truth is some shelters have to euthanize 8 out of 10 dogs that come in simply because they do not have enough space.

The application requests information about your situation, what sort of dog you wish to adopt, including age and behavior. We welcome applications from potential adopters who are able to love a dog with special physical or behavioral needs. No one is asked to adopt a dog with issues they cannot handle.\r\n\r\nWhile we usually experience a steady flow of incoming Boston Terriers needing to be re-homed, we also have a steady flow of people and families seeking to adopt a Boston Terrier through AZBTR.  We file applications, more or less, in order of receipt.  As we anticipate new dogs coming into our rescue, we attempt to fulfill those applications.  This is not always the case, however.  Our goal is to match our dogs to the best suited homes based on the individual dog's needs.\r\n\r\nIf acquiring a dog is a time sensitive issue for you or your family, rescue may not be for you.  If you are willing to wait for the right rescue to come to you, you are an ideal candidate for AZBTR.  It could be days, weeks, or months before we find a Boston Terrier that we feel is a good match for you.  As our success rate proves, these precious dogs are well worth the wait. \r\n\r\nWe carefully screen potential adoptive families, including interviewing adopters, checking references, and visiting homes. We prefer that adoptive homes have fenced yards because we do not place dogs in situations where they will be chained out or allowed to run loose. During the home visit we look for potential hazards for the Boston that the adopter may not have considered.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview phase, we are very interested to know about other pets potential adopters have or have had. Have they ever lost a pet or had one euthanized? Why? Do they have a history of lifetime commitment to their pets? How long will the dog be left alone each day and in what circumstances? Their answers to these questions help us understand if they have a history of long term commitment to their pets and they think carefully of the pets' well being.\r\n\r\nWe want adopters to be happy with their adopted Boston, too, so we learn as much as we can about the dog's history and temperament: is he\/she good with children, other dogs, cats? Everyone needs to be happy as a result of the adoption process.\r\n\r\nWe are very careful about the placements we make. We do our best to match the right Boston with the right adoptive home, because we want this to be the dog's permanent home.\r\n\r\nAdopters sign a Placement Contract with us, agreeing among other things to return the dog to us if they are not able to keep it themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Adoption Fee is based on the age of the Boston, as follows:\r\nAge of Boston \t        Fee\r\nUp to 12 months \t$300\r\n1-3 years\t                $275\r\n4-8 years \t                $250\r\n9 years and older \t$150\r\n\r\nThe Adoption Fee includes the health and ID services mentioned above. Additional medical expenses may be passed on to the adopter, based on negotiations with the adopter. We are open to discussing a lower adoption fee for senior Bostons, for adoption of more than one dog, or for adopters willing to take on a dog with an ongoing health issue. This fee schedule is in effect for Bostons adopted after June 17, 2006.\r\n\r\n","about":"Arizona Boston Terrier Rescue, Inc. (AZBTR) is an Arizona non-profit corporation dedicated to the rescue and re-homing of unwanted Boston Terriers, education of owners on responsible dog ownership, and education of the public on the Boston Terrier breed.\r\n\r\nAZBTR began life as the Rescue Committee of the Valley of the Sun Boston Terrier Club, a club founded in 1974 by a group of Boston Terrier lovers and breeders. As responsible breeders they knew that, in addition to improving and protecting the breed, it was also their obligation to help individual Bostons that needed new homes.\r\n\r\nOver the years, more and more Bostons needed help, and the Rescue Committee's operations grew to the point that it made sense to form a separate Boston Terrier rescue with the exclusive goal of helping dogs that needed new homes. Arizona Boston Terrier Rescue, Inc. was born as a free-standing non-profit corporation in 2006.\r\n\r\nToday AZBTR takes in adoptable Boston Terriers from many situations. We provide for their medical and behavioral needs, then place them in loving, permanent homes. All of our rescued dogs live with families in foster homes in Arizona. We operate statewide and occasionally take in dogs from nearby states. We do not run a shelter that you can visit. All of the rescue's operations are carried out by volunteers, most of whom have families and full-time jobs. We are very busy!\r\n\r\nThe costs of the care we provide for Bostons adds up. We charge an adoption fee for each Boston, but it rarely covers all of the costs, even for a simple case. We close the gap with fundraising activities throughout the year and donations from Boston Terrier Lovers.\r\n\r\nAZBTR follows a code of ethics that requires us to operate in a lawful and responsible fashion. For example, we are committed to spay\/neuter every dog before placement in a new home.\r\n\r\nAZBTR is a proud member of the Coalition of All Breed Rescue of Arizona.

This allows us to slowly work on getting ALL adoptable cats and kittens out of the feral colony and into loving homes. For more information on TNR, please visit Alley Cat Allies.  This is a wonderful resource for helping cats in your neighborhood as well as feral colony management.\r\n\r\nWe are not a traditional shelter, so we don't have a location or building for our rescues. All of our rescues are fostered in loving homes to help them adjust to a normal home life, not in cages. They are handled daily and given lots of love and companionship.  Generally we like to put animals in foster homes with other pets and children to try to ensure they are comfortable in many environments\/homes. \r\n\r\nWe rescue many animals from the Marlton, Cherry Hill, Delran and many areas in South Jersey, primarily. As of November 2013, we are a New Jersey-based state certified non-profit, as well as a Federally recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

Dogs adoptions are usuaslly $300 and cats are $100.  Included in the cost is UTD on shots, microchip and spay\/nueter.  ","about":"Rescue Ridge is a highly recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit, no-kill animal rescue organization in Monmouth County, that has been steadily saving lives for over ten years.  Formed by the efforts of a local woman in 2001, Terri Willis committed her life to helping the animals of our community.  Born with a severe heart defect, Terri never allowed her disability to slow her down.  Her endless love, determination and dedication to all the animals was heartwarming and remarkable.  When she passed away, the animal community lost a great advocate and rescuer.  Although no longer with us, Terri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undying spirit continues on through her dream\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The dream of Rescue Ridge.\r\n\r\nStaffed entirely by volunteers, Rescue Ridge relies exclusively on donations, sponsorships and fundraisers for support, which goes back to the animals.  With the help of our many followers and volunteers, we primarily serve the Monmouth and Ocean Counties of the Jersey Shore, but have gone much further to rescue animals in need.  Known in our area as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast chance\u00e2\u0080\u009d rescue, we have taken in many animals slated for euthanasia by shelters.  Animals come to us from all over the communities we serve for many different reasons.  We have helped animals whose owners could no longer care for them due to age, illness, behavioral or economic reasons, keeping them out of the overcrowded shelters and adopting them back into loving homes.  We have never turned away a stray or any animal in distress.  We have taken in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs that most other rescues or shelters would not even consider.  We take the time to socialize them, work with them and ultimately make them adoptable.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to take our efforts to a new level.  Committed to saving the lives of our community pets, Rescue Ridge is dedicated to the goal of introducing a no-kill shelter to Monmouth County.  Beyond a shelter, this safe haven for animals will offer our community the help it needs to finally put an end to the senseless deaths and unnecessary loss of life that these animals face daily.  Our focus will include education and affordable medical care to pet owners, keeping their animals healthy, comfortable and in their homes where they belong.  Never should a family have to surrender their pet to a shelter because they cannot afford their medical treatment.  We will also extend microchipping to our fellow animal lovers, making sure lost pets find their way home and not behind the bars of a shelter, where they can quickly wear out their welcome waiting for their family to find them.  We would be a proactive leader in putting an end to animal overpopulation by offering a true low cost spay\/neuter clinic.  A TNR (Trap & Release) Program would also be offered for feral cats, which would help keep the cat overpopulation to a minimum.  Our adoption center would be a safe and happy place, where families can come meet their new best friend.  Beyond all of this, we will offer affordable training and animal socialization to our communities, which will in turn, reinforce public safety and ensure the safety of our beloved pets.  This safe haven will be run by staff and our dedicated, experienced volunteers, many of whom have been with us for over ten years.\r\nBeing tremendous animal lovers, we all share the same belief that we can and we will make a difference, one animal at a time.  We know that this is not an easy task ahead, but there are many people and groups that will whole-heartedly support our efforts in making this happen.  And we are proud to have their encouragement.  \r\n\r\n","meetPets":"You need to make an appointment since many of our animals are in foster care or being boarded at local boarding kennels.

Thankfully now, we've been working with our local animal control and they are finally not destroying all animals deemed feral. Unfortunately, there are still too many breeding animals (feral and domestic) that need help so we can stop the needless, mass reproduction. Sometimes that's a well-meaning individual who feeds cats and after a couple of years, realizes there is a problem, or it could be an elderly person who can't afford to vet their animals. The animals not only need our advocacy but occasionally the people we help do as well. We adopt the animals that can be adopted and find special placement for others that aren't so readily \"adoptable\". ","meetPets":"We have an adoption center in our local Petsmart store (South Huntsville) or we set up a time for them to come see our animals in their foster homes.

This means we take every step necessary to ensure that the animal and the family will be comfortable with permanent placement. We strive to make all of our adopters feel like part of the JustCare family, so if you don't feel comfortable with the idea of a home-check or keeping in touch for the duration of your new pet's life, this probably isn't the rescue for you.\r\n\r\nStep one \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Adoption Application\r\n\r\nOur adoption applications are conveniently located online JustCare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adoption application is the first step to getting your new pet home with you. The applications (which differ for cats and dogs) are sent directly to our e-mail inbox. After we have received this form, we will call the personal and vet references provided and analyze your lifestyle to see which pet\/s we think will work best in your home environment.\r\n\r\nStep two \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Home Visit\r\n\r\n  JustCare typically requires a home visit for each potential adopter that Sabine and\/or Ashley does not know personally. This is just to make sure the home is appropriate for the specific animal potential adopters are interested in. This will be a brief but thorough visit to your home and\/or yard and performed either by two JustCare volunteers or Ashley and Sabine. \r\n\r\nStep three \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Meet & Greet\r\n\r\n  Once it has been determined that a potential adopter's home is the right fit for any given animal, arrangements will be made for the potential adopter and their families to meet the animal. If this is a cat, this will occur on site at JustCare Animal Rescue in Oakville WA by appointment. If this is a dog, this will occur either at the foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home or at a neutral area such as a park (especially required when meeting potential adopters dog\/s.)\r\n\r\nStep four \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Trial\r\n\r\n  Once a potential adopter decides they are interested in adding this specific animal to their home, a trial adoption period will be established. Generally for dogs this will be a 2 week trial and for cats ~6 weeks. If the adopter decides that this pairing will not work out within the trial period, a full refund of the adoption fee will be issued and the animal will come back into the rescue or foster home.","about":"We are a small group of animal loving volunteers in the Thurston\/Grays Harbor County areas who are embarking on an uphill journey to save stray and feral cats as well as other homeless animals.

Through education and volunteer programs, we promote community awareness of pet over population and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Haven is a non-profit sanctuary for animals that will be cared for regardless of how long it takes to find them loving homes.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO\r\n\r\n  The Haven was the idea and dream of Dr. Teresa Marshall, a local veterinarian, who ran The Haven out of her clinic for eleven years. In 2001 The Haven became a 501 (c) 3 non- profit organization. Also in 2001, the City of Fairhope offered use of part of the city animal shelter in return for The Haven providing veterinary care and staffing for the entire shelter. With this agreement both our need and ability to find homes for animals increased.\r\n\r\n  Many of the animals at The Haven have been neglected, starved, struck by cars, beaten, and\/or otherwise abused so the veterinary care and rehabilitation is frequently extensive and expensive. All of the animals are spayed or neutered and receive all necessary veterinary care such as de-worming, vaccinations, heartworm testing, micro-chipped, feline aids and leukemia testing, and receive 30 days of FREE pet health insurance. Potential adopters are carefully screened. Current adoption fees are $ 55 for cats and $80 for dogs. We are a no kill shelter so no adoptable animal is euthanized just because we don't find it a ready home- we just keep trying. Also we ask that if any home situation\/adoption does not work out for a Haven graduate, that the Haven be contacted so that we can find them the right home. We have the motto \"once a Haven animal, always a Haven animal\". We have frequent off -site pet adoption events, website marketing and other active marketing, as well as adoptions at the shelter - all in an effort to place animals. \r\n\r\n  Another important role The Haven plays is educating the community on the importance of spaying and neutering their pets. Our quarterly newsletter is distributed conatinaing updates from families that have recently adopted a companion for The Haven and many other pet related articles. We also have educational programs and information encouraging the humane care of animals- such as warning of the dangers of leaving pets in hot cars. We are becoming involved in the school system and discussing these issues with the children.   \r\n\r\nThe Haven would not exist though without all the tireless work of its many volunteers. Volunteers tasks are near endless including office support, walking dogs, helping at adoption and fundraising events, and, yes, cleaning cages. The Haven does various fundraisers through out the year to raise money for operations. Recent events have included a pet photo contest, a pet essay contest, a benefit luncheon featuring Fannie Flagg, and a pet Mardi Gras parade. The Haven also operates a resale shop of donated items with the proceeds benefiting The Haven. The resale shop also provides a volunteer opportunity for people who prefer not to work at the shelter itself.\r\n\r\n  The Haven is a relatively new organization that has made great strides in a short amount of time. We are proud of what we have accomplished, but we have a long way to go. We are striving to live in a society where loving, adoptable animals are not being killed. We need to change the mindset of our community that animals are disposable. \r\n\r\n  We appreciate your interest and if you have further questions feel free to contact us at (251) 929-3980, or at thehaven4animals@yahoo.com . Mail may be sent to P.O. Box 1063 Fairhope, AL 36533 .You may visit us at the shelter at 559 South Section Street in Fairhope, Ala.

No other rescue groups would take Fenway or Wrigley because black kittens are often overlooked by potential adopters, and, up until the time we rescued Lucy, rescue groups had not been allowed to rescue any dog considered to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPit Bull\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Minneapolis Animal Control.\r\n\r\nWhile in law school, Shannon McKenzie had the \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-pitbull\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy changed, with the assistance of Attorney, Marshall Tannick. Underdog Rescue continues to successfully rescue and place pitbulls and other \u00e2\u0080\u009cbully-breeds\u00e2\u0080\u009d through a continued partnership with Minneapolis Animal Control.\r\n\r\nShannon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to the Underdog also extends to puppy mill survivors. Dogs that survive life in a puppy mill often come with a different set of challenges.

Promote responsible pet ownership including vaccinations and humane education and seek suitable homes for unwanted and neglected animals.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Street Paws, Inc. is to work with local county animal control shelters, county government and other animal groups for the prevention of cruelty to animals, the relief of suffering among animals, including the reduction of animal overpopulation through spay\/neuters and publicizing the benefit thereof; promote responsible pet ownership including vaccinations, improve the lives of animals living on the streets, provide humane education to the citizenry and foster a healthy relationship between people and animals.\r\n\r\nStreet Paws, Inc. shall assist to house homeless, neglected and abused animals, provide veterinary care, seek suitable homes for animals without owners; support local shelters to maximize reclaims, adoptions and foster opportunities, to reduce euthanasia, transfer animals to other licensed animal rescue groups; and provide euthanasia when necessary.  These animals are surrendered or given to Street Paws, Inc. by their owners, animal shelters, Humane Societies, and other persons.\r\n\r\nStreet Paws, Inc. is out on the streets daily taking a progressive, proactive approach to establishing a permanent resolution to the stray companion animal problem through dedicated rescue efforts, sheltering, community outreach programs, education, collaborations, and the encouragement of responsible pet guardianship.\r\n\r\nStreet Paws Mission Statement:\r\n\r\nAny animal we come across who finds themselves without a home will not go hungry or unloved. When funds and space allow, Street Paws will take the homeless animal under our wing, notify the proper authorities, network them and try to find them a new home. We will care for and provide comfort and aid to homeless pets in a variety of ways. If the animal is tame, we will network to find a home for them. If the animal is feral, we will feed and care for the animal in their own environment. Every action will be taken to provide the animal(s) with a proper diet and bedding. Spaying and neutering these ferals is of great importance to us. We will do what we can to ensure the feral population will be kept to a minimum. We also seek to educate pet owners about the importance of spaying and neutering, annual vaccinations and the importance of a true commitment to their pet as a family member to help ensure their pet does not become another homeless statistic as well.\r\n\r\nOur current activities include:\r\n\r\nTrap-Neuter-Return (TNR) for semi-feral and feral cats. We work to get all the animals sterilized so that the overpopulation and spread of diseases is averted. Food and water stations are set up to maintain the colonies. We do not release animals that are sick or not healthy. All cats are given rabies shots prior to release. We have now sterilized 351 kitties as of February 2017. After the recommended post-op period is completed then the feral is returned to their colony. A volunteer Colony Caretaker is assigned the task of providing fresh food and water daily to ensure the quality of life for the returned ferals.\r\n\r\nFood and water program for stray, semi-feral and feral dogs. The food and water program is a network of volunteers working to sustain homeless animals that still await rescue. We supply feeders with food, when available. Volunteers drive to stations, replenish food and water and collect field data to assist with caring for the animals until a permanent solution can be found. The feeding program is critical to the animals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 survival, as well as their health and well being while they wait to be humanely trapped, spayed and neutered and rehabilitated.\r\n\r\nEducation- Street Paws, Inc. has developed specific information about the practice of Trap-Neuter-Return of feral felines, spay\/neuter, heartworms, vaccinations and a new dog fact sheet and disseminate this information via our website, flyers, and education for children in schools.

Once you have completed an application, we will contact you to talk about a specific dog  about whom you\u2019ve expressed interest. \r\n\r\nAfter you\u2019ve been approved, we arrange for you to meet the dog, either at an adoption event or in a one-on-one introduction. Often, you can go home with your new companion the same day, though for some dogs\u2014small puppies and special-needs animals\u2014we will schedule a home visit before finalizing the adoption. Or, you may FOSTER an animal with the intent to adopt to ensure a good fit for both of you.\r\nWe ask for donations to help us cover spay\/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat if the adoption doesn't work out?\r\n     We have a lifetime return policy on our dogs, however, we have the application process to help prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions.  Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it's imperative that you are forthright in the application process so we can help find the right match.  However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult.  A dog is not a novelty or a toy, so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nADOPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n    * We often have many applications for a certain animal.  Please be advised that we will not be letting each person who submits an application know how many others are interested, just keep in mind that there may be others interested so it is best to schedule your meet and greet as soon as possible.  Sometimes people who submit applications do not follow through or are not approved so we want all applications to be reviewed in order to make sure that we put all our effort into choosing the best home for our rescues.  This is why we do not stop accepting applications just because one person is interested in the dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Just because your adoption application is approved, does not mean you have been approved to adopt the dog.  The purpose of the meet and greet which is scheduled once the application is approved is a chance for YOU to see if the dog would make a good fit and for US to decide if we feel the dog would make a good fit for your family.  Any representative at Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has the right to decide to what family we adopt our dogs into.  It is not first come first serve, it is best family best serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Additionally, if you are approved for adoption after the meet and greet, we can offer many different ways for you to take the pet including placing an adoption hold, fostering to adopt, or adopt via spay\/neuter contract (meaning you are agreeing to take the dog unaltered into your home under the condition that one of our representatives will be taking the dog to get fixed between the prescribed time period).\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Adoption holds are not offered until we meet you in person.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * So please when you are filling out an application don't rush to the store to buy dog supplies or tell your children about your new adopted dog because there is always a possibility that someone else may adopt before you or that you may not be considered the best fit for the particular dog after the meet and greet and\/or homecheck.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * All dogs are microchipped to us and you will be added as the alternative contact.  Our dogs are rescued by us for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Also, any foster family working with Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has priority in whatever dog they are fostering; that is if I let them know that someone is interested and approved to meet the dog, if the foster wishes to adopt they will be our first choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * These terms and conditions are set forth to not only protect our rescue and our dogs in ensuring that they go to the best home possible but also to protect your emotions and well-being.  We know that the possibility of adopting a dog is very exciting but it is important to follow the process and understand that the dog is not considered yours for adoption until an adoption contract has been signed. ","about":"*We are NOT a shelter, therefore, we do not have a central place where you can meet the dogs. All dogs are in foster care getting ready for their forever homes*\r\n\r\nBarks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services is a non-profit corporation staffed as a volunteer group, established in June 2008 originally as Second Chances Rescue by Ashley Greenspan. Our goal is to decrease the total number of animals being euthanized in animal shelters each year by finding new, permanent homes for them. Our animals come from a variety of circumstances.\r\n\r\nMost of them are rescued from \"Death Row\" at local shelters, while others are brought to us by their owners as an alternative to the shelter, and others are just found afraid and abandoned on the streets.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet have our own kennel facility, so all of the animals we take in live in \"foster homes\" or with their owners until they are adopted.\r\n\r\nBarks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has no paid employees and does not receive funding from any government agency.\r\n\r\nWe are staffed entirely by volunteers and obtain funds solely from adoption fees, fund-raisers, and donations.\r\n\r\nIn order to ultimately reduce the number of unwanted animals killed each year, we feel it is important to educate prospective owners and the general public about pet overpopulation and enforce a very strict spay\/neuter policy for all our adopted pets.\r\n\r\nWe spay or neuter all animals before placement regardless of breed.\r\n\r\nAll dogs are then rehabilitated, loved and cared for, bathed, vaccinated, microchipped, have had a vet evaluation, and are free of internal and external parasites.\r\n\r\nWe are also looking for foster homes, please open your hearts and homes.\r\n\r\nAll adoption fees go 100% directly into rescuing and caring for our dogs.\r\n\r\n \r\nFAQS\r\n\r\nWhy we don't have a shelter or facility where you can come see the dogs:\r\n\r\nWe have a strong foster care program instead. Our goal is to get dogs out of shelters and into nurturing foster homes or permanent homes immediately. Dogs  experience many of the same emotions as humans, such as stress, loneliness and depression. So we try to avoid having to put a rescue animal right back into a kennel environment if we can.\r\n\r\nThe difference between us and the SPCA or Humane Society:\r\nThe main difference is physical: We are an independent organization that primarily operates out of volunteers' homes, without a facility. We rescue animals OUT of primarily municipal shelters (city- and county-funded shelters whose adoption rates are very low in comparison to the number of animals taken in). We work in partnership with these animal shelters to rescue adoptable dogs. Often a rescue group like ours is the only hope these particular shelter dogs  have for a new life.\r\n \r\nThere are also benefits to adopting a dog from an organization like Barks of Love:\r\n\r\n    * Since we visit a variety of animal shelters to rescue dogs, we can be on the lookout for the specific type of animal you are interested in.\r\n    * Most of our adoptable animals have been in foster care--in a regular home environment--so we have a good idea of how each of our animals will behave in the real world. For dogs, we usually know if a dog is housebroken, good with other dogs, good with cats, appropriate for children or not, energy\/activity level, and so forth. This makes it easier to match up our dogs with the right home, and easier for you to select the right one.\r\n    * Our dogs have already been vet-checked, vaccinated, dewormed, and spayed\/neutered before adoption. While no one can guarantee the long-term health of any animal, we do take the time and incur the expense to get basic healthcare and assessments done before our dogs go to permanent homes.\r\n    * When you adopt from us, your pet already has close to $300.00 of care invested in it before you take him\/her home! Of course, the tender-loving care they receive from their foster parents, as we prepare them for their new permanent homes, is priceless!","meetPets":"By making appointments after and application has been approved or at public adoption events.","services":"adoptions, volunteer, fostering, fundraising, help with rehoming, rescuing from shelters, legal help","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

He is now 18, and ever since he was little the connection he has with animals is amazing and the connection they have with him amazes us!  So thru his love of animals and his compassionate heart we knew what we had to do for him.  He won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever be able to work, and needs 24 hour care, most doctors had such bleak outcomes for him, but we knew better...there is a purpose and the connection was so clear.  So many special needs children and adults are given up on, just like so many animals are just thrown to the side and given up on, and the more we worked with animals with Jonah and saw the growth in him, and the spirit inside him come alive and watch an animal understand him and respond we knew what we needed to do.  Which brings us to the second goal..rescue animals in need, that have been told there is nothing left for you, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help you, accept your fate..well for these animals that is a death sentence. If we can rescue them and provide hope for a future and in return give hope to young adults like Jonah at the same time then we all win.  We have watched first hand the miracle that happens between these animals and special needs people, they connect on a level that we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, its our goal to provide a way for this to happen in both their lives.

The application will be reviewed by members of CSAC Placement team. The review process includes a background check, and whenever appropriate, a check and verification of the veterinary history of the applicant's present or previously owned animals. If the application is approved, we will contact the applicant by phone or email to set up a home visit. A home visit will be scheduled at a mutually convenient time.  If all goes well, the approved applicant can schedule a meet and greet with the dog they are interested in adopting. The final stage of the adoption process is filling out the Adoption Agreement, which is signed by the adopter(s) and a CSAC representative.\r\n\r\nAdoption fees:\r\n$400 - puppy to 1 year 11 months,\r\n$350 - 2 years to 4 years 11 months,\r\n$300 - 5 years to 8 years 11 months,\r\n$250 - 9 years and older\r\nAdoption fees are required to help offset the large expenses incurred caring for the dogs. On average, the adoption fee covers 60% of the expenses.\r\n\r\nBy the time of adoption, all dogs have been examined at least once by one or more board certified veterinarians. The dogs move into their forever homes having had all the treatment and care we can adequately determine they need, including -- but not limited to -- vaccinations, spaying and neutering and heartworm tests. Everything possible is done to reasonably ensure the health and well-being of our dogs.\r\n\r\nEvery attempt is made to assess the temperament and behavior of the animals, and they will be as socialized as possible under the circumstances. We are honest with potential adopters about our dogs, and all available information is disclosed. We make no guarantees about the health or temperament of any of our rescue dogs, as we often know so little of their history, but we do all we can to determine and take care of as much as possible under the circumstances. Our primary objective is to see these formerly unfortunate animals placed in safe, secure homes, where they will be loved and accepted as family members for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we will feature mixed breed dogs and other breeds in need of homes. You may even see a cat or two appear on our pages. We will not turn our backs on any animal in need.\r\n\r\nIf you want a special lifetime companion, please view our list of adoptable animals. These dogs want so much to please people, and many have been senselessly abandoned, sometimes abused, by people they should have been able to trust. We hope you are willing to help us give them a second chance at the lives they truly deserve.\r\n","about":"Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is a virtual rescue. We do not own a brick and mortar building. We are a network of fosters, adopters, and rescue partners. Primarily located in north-eastern Maryland and south-central Pennsylvania, CSAC accepts applications from anywhere someone is willing to drive from and pick up a dog. As an all volunteer organization, we may be limited by the number of volunteers in any geographical location. It may not be possible to complete our application process, i.e. a home visit, depending on your geographic location, but we will try out best.\r\n\r\nWe strive to rescue cocker spaniels and provide them with the medical, emotional, and behavioral care they need to become great pets.  We find safe, loving, forever homes for the rescued cocker spaniels in our care. \r\n\r\nCocker Spaniel Adoption Center Inc, founded in 1995, and incorporated in 2003, grew out of the need to find adoptive homes for the ever-increasing number of Cocker Spaniels showing up in local kill-shelters and county humane societies. Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is comprised entirely of volunteers that assist in the rescue and placement of Cocker Spaniels (and honorary Cocker Spaniels) throughout the East Coast of the United States and Canada. \r\n\r\nCocker Spaniel Adoption Center is different in its approach to rescue than many other breed rescues.  We accept all cocker spaniels into our rescue, regardless of age or medical condition; not just the young and healthy that are easily adoptable and inexpensive to rescue.  We believe all dogs have love to give someone.  The Cocker Spaniel Adoption Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization, and your donations are entirely tax deductible.","meetPets":"CSAC volunteers attend a lot of adoption events in both MD and PA and usually have one or more adoptable dogs at the events.

The application should be emailed to fortheloveofbirdsnj@gmail.com. Be sure to include two personal references and a veterinary reference. We check the references and then will reach out to you to schedule a mutually convenient time to talk on the phone. After your application is approved and based on your preferences, lifestyle and bird experience we will recommend a bird(s) for you to meet. Or you can let us know if you are interested in adopting one of our available birds.\r\n \r\nFor small birds like finches and budgies, they typically can be adopted after one visit to their foster home. Medium to large parrots require at least three visits with the bird at their foster home. The reason for this is three fold. This provides the potential adopter with time to consider whether the bird is a good match with their family and life style and gives you time to get your house ready for the bird to move in. Second it gives the bird several opportunities to meet with you and get used to you. Many birds are hesitant with new people during their first visit meeting with them. And finally, it allows the foster home to watch how you interact with the bird and they can pass along information on the bird and educate the potential adopter on bird husbandry as needed. All of our adoptable birds are cared for in private foster homes throughout New Jersey. Each of our birds are treated as the unique individual that they are.\r\n \r\nPlease note that we require a waiting period of at least 6 months between bringing new birds into your home. Each bird requires a transition period to be comfortable with their new family and in their new home. Please don't short change your bird by bringing another flock member in too soon.\r\n \r\nThere is an adoption fee; fees are listed on our website. Our birds are sent home with their cage, toys and some food to get you started. Additionally, all of our birds are disease tested for Polyoma, Psitticosis and PBFD, and we will give you a copy of the test results.\r\n \r\nFor The Love of Birds holds a permit for the care and sale of exotic animals from the State of New Jersey, Division of Fish and Wildlife. All exotic birds that are not exempt in New Jersey must have a hobby permit filed with the state. We will issue you a 20 day temporary permit at the time of adoption. We must file a copy of this temporary hobby permit each year with the Division of Fish and Wildlife. You will need to file for a hobby permit during the first 20 days you have the bird. Exempt birds are budgies, cockatiels, canaries, zebra finches, rock pigeons and society finches. There are a few other exempt birds that we do not take in and offer for adoption. Additionally, all other exotic birds are required to have a band or microchip and have a hobby permit from the State of New Jersey, Division of Fish and Wildlife. YOU DO NOT NEED A SEPARATE PERMIT FOR EACH ANIMAL IN YOUR POSSESSION. If you already have a valid Individual Hobby Permit, you can add additional animals for a fee of $2.00 by writing to the Division of Fish and Wildlife or you can wait until the end of the year and list additions on your renewal form which will be sent to you.\r\n ","about":"For the Love of Birds is exclusively for charitable and educational purposes of companion birds through rescue, care and placement.\r\n \r\nParrots can live long lives, 20 to 80 years, and because of this and by virtue of not being a domesticated animal, they will end up living in multiple homes for various reasons; unfulfilled expectations, death, moving, loss of job, life changes, etc of caregivers.

We are not in the business of selling pets and as such we are not a cash and carry rescue.  When we refer to a \"fur\u2665ever home\" we expect a lifelong commitment to the adoptive dog you have chosen to adopt.  Our adoption process is designed to help carefully match a pet with both your lifestyle and well as their individual needs in mind.  This can take some time, but using this method has produced a high success rate of happy adoptions.    Our goal is to have this be a happy and certainly the final happy home for our sheltie.    \r\n\r\nAdopting a New Companion\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff  \r\n\r\nIf you are applying for one of our dogs from out of state, please note that we  DO NOT SHIP OUR DOGS.  If you are truly interested in adopting from Sheltie Shack Rescue you must be willing to make the trip to meet us and your potential new family member.  We expect the entire family to come, including any other current canine companions, as there is no other way to assure compatibility of all family members.  We have had many successful out of state adoptions and encourage you to apply if you can comply with these travel requirements.  We do not place our dogs in homes where current pets are not properly vaccinated, not on heartworm preventative or not  spayed or neutered unless there is a medical reason for not doing so or the dog is actively being shown in conformation.  We only place dogs in homes where they will be indoor pets and never left outdoors when no one is home.  For all puppies and nearly all of our adult dogs, a fenced yard is required.  On occasion we may have a well socialized, leash trained adult or senior sheltie that will do fine in a condo\/town house\/apartment environment where a responsible adopter will agree that all outside activities will ONLY take place on a leash.  This such determination will be made on a case by case basis.  We do NOT approve of electric\/invisible fences, dog runs or tie out chains.  Shelties adopted from us must be kept on heartworm preventative (Interceptor, no Ivermectin based products).\r\n\r\nHow to Submit an Application \r\n \r\n\u2022Apply online\r\n  \r\n\u2022Download an application (MS Word)\r\n  \r\n\u2022We will review the application, and will contact you by phone and\/or e-mail with any questions we might have.  If your written application is approved, a home visit will be scheduled next.  Since we often have volunteers do our home visits, we will contact you after getting their report and let you know if you've been approved to come meet the dog(s) of interest and hopefully adopt your next family companion.  If your application is not approved upon initial submittal, we will let you know within the next 24 hours or if at any time during the adoption process we feel you are not a good fit for the dog you are interested in, for whatever reason, you will also be notified per phone or e-mail. \r\n \r\n\u2022Adoption fees cover the spay\/neuter surgery, vaccinations, heart worm testing (treatment if necessary), dentals (when necessary) and worming. Other medical needs are addressed on a per need basis of each individual dog.  You will find that our fee is considerably less expensive than going to the vet yourself with a newly purchased dog from a breeder because our vets support rescue and provide reduced rates for their services.  Although we ask for a minimum adoption fee, we are always appreciative of any additional donation that helps defray costs such as travel expenses, food, bedding, toys and grooming services that are not factored into the adoption fee as well as set monthly operational expenditures.  \r\n\r\n\u2022An Adoption Contract for each dog will be signed as the last step of the adoption process. The contract is a binding and legal document that provides for returning the dog to Sheltie Shack Rescue if the adopter is no longer able to keep dog and allows for quick reclaim if there is abuse; the animal is found roaming free; or the dog is suffering from neglect.  You can expect a follow up inquiry as to how the adopted dog is doing and, hopefully, you would like to share your success story with us to post on the web.    \r\n\r\nWhere To See Our Dogs  \r\n\r\n\r\nSince we do not operate a shelter facility, only approved applicants will be invited to come and meet the dog(s) they are interested in and approved to adopt.  Since not all dogs are located at the same foster home, arrangements will be made on an individual bases as to where this meeting will take place and where the adoption will be completed.\r\n","about":"OUR MISSION as a small, totally volunteer nonprofit group, who give of their time, ability and even their homes is to provide for the rescue, care and placement of shelties who have been abandoned, neglected and\/or given up by their owners for various reasons.

Our mission is to rescue, provide refuge, and ultimately to find permanent loving homes for abandoned, stray and neglected animals where they will receive a lifetime commitment of loving care, including appropriate gentle training, exercise, and regular veterinary care. Whenever possible we also assist dogs who, because of extenuating circumstances, are unable to remain in their homes with their guardians. We are located in Central Vermont, and work with local and national organizations to help prevent needless euthanasia, and companion animal overpopulation. \r\n\r\nGood Karma rescue supports early age spay\/neuter as the most practical and humane way to prevent companion animal overpopulation and needless euthanasia. All dogs and puppies adopted from Good Karma rescue prior to going to their forever home are spayed or neutered. Our organization acknowledges the serious problem of overpopulation of companion animals in this country, and works to prevent unwanted litters.\r\n\r\nAll Good Karma are housed in foster homes where they are provided with attention and all are seen by a veterinarian to insure, as much as is possible, that they are in good health before adoption. All companion animals are spayed or neutered, brought up-to-date on shots, and screened for parasites before being placed in their new homes. When time permits, our dogs are also housetrained and taught basic obedience. \r\n\r\nAll Good Karma animals are evaluated for temperament, and personality. This helps us to place them in homes that are well suited to their needs and to the needs of their future guardians. If you are looking for a specific type of dog and do not see it on our website, please email us.

We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. Our adoption process may seem time consuming or unnecessarily complicated, but please understand that we have our dogs'\u0080\u0099 best interests at heart. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.\r\nPlease understand that our organization is completely run by unpaid volunteers, who dedicate their free time to help the dogs. The entire adoption process takes time; we are unwilling to sacrifice being thorough when the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future is at stake. We thank you for your time and patience throughout our adoption process.\r\nFill out Adoption Application\r\nThe first step is to have you fill out a adoption application. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, training beliefs and background with animals.\r\n\r\nApplication Review\r\nOur application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nVerifications\r\nIf it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations.\r\nIf your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\nIf you are adopting a bully-breed we will contact your insurance to assure they do not have breed restrictions within their policy.\r\n\r\nVeterinary Reference Contacted\r\nOur volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed\/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped.\r\nIf your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay\/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be stopped until you can provide this information.\r\nApplicant Interview\r\nA volunteer from Grey Face Rescue will contact you via phone to get to know you better along with ask any questions they may have.\r\nMeet & Greet\r\nOur organization does not have a shelter where the dogs can be visited. Our dogs are in foster homes. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our fosters until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process.\r\nOnce you have been approved, a volunteer (usually the foster) will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. This meeting may occur at the foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s residence or your home.\r\nJust because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. For some dogs we receive many applications so we may allow multiple applicants to have a meeting with the dog before we choose the home that we feel will be the best fit for the dog. Also, if the volunteer involved in the meeting with you and the dog, does not feel you are a good fit for the dog, you may be denied adoption of that particular dog but you may be allowed to adopt another dog.\r\nAdoption\r\nIf you have decided upon a dog that you would like to adopt you are required to sign an adoption contract and to provide payment of the adoption donation fee and spay\/neuter deposit if necessary.  At that time you become the owner of the dog.\r\nWe will then provide a couple cups of the dog food they have currently been eating, Grey Face Adoption tag, all medical and vet documents, a copy of the contract, transition packet to help in the transition process, a letter from the dogs foster giving you a more in depth info on the dogs likes, dislikes, behaviors, etc. Also, fosters may include specific toys or blankets the dog has become fond of.\r\nWe have a two week refund period meaning if you decide the dog is not a good fit for your family and you return him\/her within the two week refund period we will return your adoption donation to you. The adoption fee will be deposited upon receipt and refunded only if the adopted dog is returned within the two week refund period (or any prior agreed upon extension of the refund period).\r\nIf at any time you are having issues with the dog, please email or call your contact person and inform us. A volunteer will be in touch with you asap.\r\nOptional Post Adoption Follow-Up Visit\r\nOur adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. Grey Face Rescue is committed to the life, health and well being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome the dog, we require, by contract that the dog be returned to us.

All animals will be spayed\/neutered and fully vetted prior to adoption.  The only exception would be small puppies in which case the adopter will submit an additional deposit refundable upon proof of spay\/neuter.  In the event an animal is no longer wanted, the adoption contract will stipulate that the animal always gets returned to us, and is never sold, given away, or surrendered to another rescue or shelter.  ","about":"In many areas of the country, especially in the South, the situation for animals is desperate:   Chained outside and starving, homeless and running loose, or just simply no longer wanted and abandoned in an overburdened and underfunded facility that can\u2019t possibly take another.  For these animals, there is not much hope\u2026except to look in the night sky for the North Star, their only way out.  We are a group of passionate volunteers committed to saving these innocent dogs and finding them a new forever home. NorthStar Pet Rescue was founded in 2017, and although we might be a relatively new name among New Jersey animal rescues, you may recognize some of us from the work we\u2019ve done volunteering with other rescues to help animals over the past decade. We are 100% dedicated to operating in an safe, transparent, and ethical manner and to ensuring the best veterinary practices are followed with regards to the care and transport of our animals. NorthStar Pet Rescue is IRS 501(c)(3) charitable organization (EIN: 81-5348036).","meetPets":"We are a foster-based organization and have no facility.

When they went home in the fall, many summer visitors would leave behind the cats they had been feeding all summer to face the winter without food or shelter. Those that survived would inevitably breed in the spring, producing litters of feral kittens that would eventually produce more unwanted kittens. Something had to be done to stop the litters and so Town Cats was born to spay\/neuter\/vaccinate the feral cats of Ocean City.","meetPets":"All cats are in foster homes.

The hoarder surrendered the cats to the Young Williams Animal Center (YWAC) on February 9. The Stray Connection was asked by YWAC to help with these cats on Friday, February 17. On Saturday, February 18, Stray Connection volunteers evaluated all 60 cats. Several of the cats had serious medical issues, upper respiratory infections, or were very scared or asocial.\r\n\r\nThe Stray Connection took six cats on Sunday, February 19, and placed three additional cats into foster care on Saturday, February 25. Aslin, a beautiful Maine Coon, is severely underweight, and has a heart murmur. He also had trauma to his tail when he was younger. The first five vertebrae are fused so he cannot bend that portion of this tail, but he can wag the back half of his tail. Maddie is a long haired Himalayan mix female who suffers from cataracts and a condition called nystagmus, also known as quivering eyes. Clawdia is a petite female calico cat who is severely underweight and malnourished. Two of the cats, Mr Finnegan and Sir Keegan, have muscle atrophy in their back legs that should, thankfully, correct itself with proper nutrition and exercise. At this point, they are so week they have trouble walking and simply standing on their back legs, probably due to prolonged time spent in a cage or carrier. You can feel every bone in Sir Keegan's body with ease. He is filthy from being forced to lie in urine and feces for extended periods. Unlike animals from other hoarding cases, they are expected to fully recover and live healthy, happy lives.\r\n\r\nAll of the rescued cats are negative for feline leukemia and aids and about 1-2 years old. The Stray Connection intends find a good, permanent home for each of these loving cats. We will continue to help YWAC until all 60 cats are placed. The Stray Connection is also dedicated to sharing information on hoarding and abuse. In bringing the public\u2019s attention to this, we hope to curtail the excess of brutal and senseless animal neglect and abuse by increasing community awareness, encouraging and supporting individuals to report any information or suspicions concerning possible hoarding, abuse or neglect situations to local authorities (e.g., animal control officers or local law enforcement officers).

Once rehabilitated and ready, they are carefully matched with prospective adopters and placed in loving homes. Over 23,000 pets have been adopted from Animal House Shelter.\r\n\r\nLike people, animals have distinct personalities that make them unique. At Animal House Shelter, we are proud to say that the dogs and cats are treated like our own. We care enough to be certain they are treated with the comfort and respect that they deserve and we make every effort to ensure that they go to the right, forever, permanent, loving home.\r\n\r\nThe best possible veterinary care is always given to Animal House Shelter pets and treatment is never declined if it will give the animal a chance for a healthy life. Socializing and keeping our pets happy is also of utmost importance. Dogs are walked 4-5 times daily and cats are housed in a large, whimsical, free-roam habitat All are given loving care and attention by staff and volunteers.\r\n\r\n All dogs and cats are given all vaccinations- including their Rabies vaccine if old enough. They are neutered,  microchipped,  dewormed and heartworm tested (Dogs)  or FeLV\/FIV tested (Cats). Dogs are kept on heartworm preventative & all animals receive Frontline Plus monthly by Animal House.\r\n\r\nAnimal House takes in many special needs animals.  We take care of any ailment or surgery that needs to be done on any animal we rescue including, but not limited to: heart worm treatments, cruciate ligament repair, patella surgery, FHO, heart surgery, diabetes, anxiety disorders, auto immune deficiencies, liver shunts etc.  On average, AHS takes in at least one animal per week that has one of the above ailments or needs surgery.  We do not believe that any animal should be left to be euthanized at a high kill facility because they are sick or injured.  Society has already failed them at one point in time and someone needs to speak up and rescue those that are defenseless and without a voice.  That is who we are are and that is what Animal House Shelter has always been about.  These ailments & surgeries are extremely expensive and we need the communities help to not leave these poor souls to be discarded with no one to care for them.","meetPets":"Animal House Shelter is open Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 11 AM to 7 PM, Tuesday from 11 am to 4 pm and Saturday's 9 AM to 7 PM.

If you already have your eye on a specific baby, you can write their name in on the form, if not, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry we will help make the perfect match for you. Please remember that just because you write a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name in, that it is not a guarantee that dog will be available. If we have multiple applicants on a dog we will be looking for the best fit for that dog, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry we will help you!\r\nAfter you complete the adoption application we will email you to let you know it has been received. A volunteer will begin processing the application which consists of: verifying information, completing a vet reference, checking personal references, and lastly a home visit to be approved.\r\nCommon Questions:\r\nHow long does it take?\r\nApplications take on average 1-2 weeks to complete. Please remember we are all volunteers. A great way to speed this up is to let your references know they will be receiving a call from us, one of the number one reasons applications get slowed down is waiting on return calls from your references. You may also want to let your vet know we are calling as some won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t release information without your consent. Also, double check the phone numbers. addresses, and emails you provide.\r\nWhy do you ask so many questions?\r\nDogs coming from our rescue have ended up with us because someone along the way failed them. Our commitment is to the dogs and we want to make sure to get the right match. Maybe you have your heart set on Fluffy, but Fluffy is terrified of elevators and you live on the 12th floor of a condo building. Fluffy might not be the right dog for you, but with all the information we have we can show you some other matches that might be just what you are looking for!\r\nWhat happens if the dog I want is adopted?\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry! The right match is out there for you and we will help you consider other possibilities that meet your needs.\r\nWhy should I apply if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the right dog yet?\r\nIf you are looking to adopt a \u00e2\u0080\u009chighly desirable\u00e2\u0080\u009d dog we suggest getting pre-approved. Dogs that are young (under 3, and especially puppies), female, very small (under 15 lbs), etc usually have a lot of interest. If the dog you are looking for fits any of those characteristics, we recommend getting on the approved list now. When the dog you are looking for pops up you can let us know immediately to be first in line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","about":"Allow me to introduce the new face of Boston Terrier Rescue of Florida, Inc.\r\nOur existing Beautiful Logo of Three Boston Terrier heads in the Profile picture also signifies the three components of our Rescue, The Rescue Ranch, located in Georgia, The Senior Centers, located in Tennessee, and The Pups In Need program (P.I.N.) here in Florida.

We house & care for approximately 40 dogs at any given time. Our dogs arrive in our care in many ways; owner surrenders, strays & we pull from local high-intake shelters.\r\n \r\nWe have an equal balance of dogs that need medical care, behavioral rehabilitation & some dogs that are just ready to get into that new home today.  All of our dogs leave our care spayed\/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped & heartworm tested (if positive, we treat them). \r\n \r\nWe were developed based on the fact that there is a gap in the system here locally.  The shelters that are open-intake, although they are doing the best they can, they can only do so much.  Those shelters are also very stressful to the dogs & this is where we step in.  You can consider our place a half-way home for dogs if you will.  We allow the dogs to be dogs again, offering them behavioral modification, land to run on, playgroups & necessary vet care.  With this being said, our adoption rate is sometimes slowed due to the fact the dog(s) may not be ready for adoption right away.  We set our dogs up for success & match them with the right family.  Our final goal is to have the adoptions last the dog's lifetime.\r\n \r\nOur #1 goal though is to have a dog stay in their current home, should it be safe.  We offer counseling & resources to do our best to make this happen.  When it's not possible, they may safely surrender the dog to us, provided we have space. \r\n \r\nPlease consider donating to our cause.  You can revisit our website & watch while we grow, or help us grow by making a donation.  We are a licensed shelter through the state of Missouri & a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

These dogs do not do well in shelters, and will not get adopted. At our sanctuary, these dogs have a promise of a forever home, but are also promoted for adoption because there's nothing better than your very own human. Jeanne Lou's mission is to rescue chained\/penned and yard-sale dogs. A lot of these dogs tend to be the smaller breeds, thus the name, Little Big Dog, because we rescue the little ones and the big ones. Jeanne Lou's rescues are placed in foster homes, vetted, s\/n'd, socialized, and offered for adoption.","meetPets":"Jeanne Lou and Dot both have multi-dog households.

We provide resources to help reunite lost pets and their owners. (And our pets are adopted with microchips that can be transferred to their new forever family.)

We are a group of volunteers that have a passion for animals and the rescue mission of finding loving homes for the animals under our care.\r\n\r\nNo loving companions are adopted out until they are spayed or neutered, check by a veterinarian, vaccinated and tested.  \r\n\r\nFoster homes are always scarce and in high demand so if you can open your hearts and your home to help our animals it would be much appreciated. Every foster makes it possible for another unwanted animal to find a loving home. Locations in the Lawton area would be ideal but no home will be excluded for consideration. \r\n\r\nWhat would a non-profit be without donations? Remember donations are all tax deductible. Wouldn't you rather give to loving cause then Good old Uncle Sam! If you are like us, we have already given at the office!\r\n\r\nBarn homes are needed from time to time for our felines that just can't seem to adjust living with us humans. So, we would like to see them put to work catching those pesky little rodents. We will make sure you will have a healthy and vetted cat, if you will make sure the cat has a warm shelter from our cold winter nights, supplemental food and water and a kind eye out for his\/her needs. The cat will make sure to provide you with a rodent free barn. It's a win\/win situation.\r\n\r\nAre you a literary giant like Hemingway or Steinbeck and can plead a case? We need grant writers!

There is no application fee required to apply. The application process consists of the following: written application, reference check, phone interview, and lastly a home environment verification; which may be either a physical home visit by a GLWR volunteer or possibly a digital tour of the home depending upon logistics and timing. The application process from start to finish can take approximately 5-10 days.\r\n\r\nOnce that process is complete a GLWR Adoption Coordinator will be assigned to work with you talk with you about our interests and to help you determine what available dogs we have in the rescue that may be a good fit for your family. Once a potential match is determined you will be connected to the foster family who will provide you with more personal detail about the particular dog and set up a time for you to come and visit with the dog in their home.\r\n\r\nWe understand that it seems like a long process to get through to just meet a dog, however, we want to ensure that dogs and families are a good match for each other and that the dog you are interested in is still available at the time you are approved to adopt. We also feel it important to have potential adopter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s screened adequately to ensure that we know who may be engaging with our volunteer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and visiting our foster family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homes. Their peace of mind and safety is of utmost importance to GLWR. \r\n\r\nIn order to visit a fostered Weimaraner, all members of the adopting family must travel to the location of the dog in order to give the dog the most comfortable environment to meet prospective adopters. This includes any current family animals as well. If things go well the adopters can take their new rescue weim home with them that day, after they sign the GLWR contract. \r\n\r\nThe contract is very comprehensive and states, among other things, that dogs must be kept in humane conditions and that if they are not a fit they must be surrendered back to the GLWR. Once a dog is in our rescue it is part of the GLWR family and we keep an active relationship with the adopters to ensure the best chance of success for both the dog and the family. \r\n\r\nThe adoption fee schedule is as follows:\r\n\r\n$450 - Puppies\/Dogs that are aged between 8 weeks through year 1\r\n\r\n$400 - Dogs aged 2 years through year 3\r\n\r\n$350 - Dogs aged 4 years through year 6\r\n\r\n$300 - Dogs aged 7 years through year 9\r\n\r\n$250 - Dogs aged 10 years and up\r\n\r\n\r\n","about":"GLWR is a foster based rescue organization and does not have a traditional physical kennel facility like many humane societies or animal shelters do. Our dogs are typically housed in family homes and cared for by their foster families until we find a forever home for them. Therefore, our process to meet dogs and to adopt may be different than a normal animal control facility, humane society or animal shelter.\r\n\r\nAll-volunteer group\r\nGreat Lakes Weimaraner Rescue is an all-volunteer group and our mission is the rescue and placement of Weimaraners in the Great Lakes Region. We work with a network of shelters in several states, as well as owners needing to relinquish their dog. We are a determined group of people, but we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything without your support.\r\n\r\nDogs come first\r\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stopped counting the hours of sleep lost with sick dogs and the miles driven to spring others from shelters. The volunteers of GLWR sacrifice daily to give each dog a chance to enjoy a good life. Your generous assistance with driving, gas cards, phone work, fundraising  and dog care makes it possible for us to come to the aid of hundreds of dogs.\r\n\r\nNo-kill philosophy\r\nGLWR adheres to a no-kill philosophy, and we will never euthanize a dog to make space for another. The waiting list for Weims in need never ends and we do all we can to take dogs in before they, well, cease to need us anymore. Occasionally a dog dies before we can take it in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 haunting our dreams and fueling our determination to never lose another.\r\n\r\nHappy, healthy dogs\r\nFrom the moment a dog is part of GLWR, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical and emotional needs are assessed and provided for. We believe in doing everything possible to help dogs make the transition into their \u00e2\u0080\u009cforever\u00e2\u0080\u009d home. Medical costs are our largest expense and your donations allow us to address health issues without delay.\r\n\r\nWhy we do it?\r\nWe are here for the Weimaraners and the Weimaraners alone. Our reward lies not in the accolades of being \u00e2\u0080\u009crescuers\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but in the gratitude we see in the bright, loving eyes of dogs that once were sad, dejected and without hope. With your help, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given them a chance to experience the warmth of a family that will love and care for them.\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"People can visit our adoptable pets after they complete the application process.

Shelter From The Storm is an all breed cat and dog rescue and focuses on alleviating overcrowding in shelters and helping adoptable\/treatable animals. Since its inception, Shelter from the Storm helped the Humane Society of the United States during Hurricane Katrina by transporting over 100 animals to safety in Wisconsin, where they were vetted, placed in foster care and ultimately place in forever homes. We also worked with the HSUS in dealing with a local hoarding situation at the Thyme and Sage Ranch in Richland Center, Wisconsin. Thyme and Sage was operating as an animal rescue and as the animal control agency for that area, but was housing in excess of 300 animals.\r\n\r\nMany of our pets are placed into a home environment with a suitable foster home. Here they begin basic training, receive socialization, and learn what it's like to live in a home. We also attend to their medical needs including vaccinations, heartworm testing, feline leukemia\/FIV testing, deworming, and flea\/tick prevention.\r\n \r\nIn 2008, in furtherance of its mission, Spay Me! Clinic was opened. Dr. Richard Brown, Elizabeth Yohn, CVT, and Allison Davies, have all performed high volume spay\/neuter procedures in a variety of locations and settings and used their knowledge to set up Spay Me! Clinic. At the beginning, surgeries were performed once a week and gradually expanded to six days a week by the end of 2009. Currently, we have two veterinarians, two certified veterinary technicians and several highly trained veterinary assistants on staff. We also utilized volunteers from the general public, volunteer veterinarians, and CVT's. Our clinic provides a great educational setting for veterinary and veterinary technician students who want to learn more about shelter medicine and high volume spay\/neuter procedures.\r\n\r\nSpay Me! Clinic is open to the public, but a main element of the clinic is to extend a helping hand to other rescues and shelters by offering spay\/neuter services at a lower cost. Since we are also a rescue, we understand the importance of running a business and keeping costs down. Our veterinarians and staff have become skilled in high volume spay\/neuter procedures and continue to expand their skill set. Additional procedures have gradually been added and now include dentals, amputations, foreign object removals, and ACL repairs, to name a few. These \"special\" procedures are reserved for shelters, rescues, and individuals that have a financial need.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are spaying and neutering over 12,000 dogs and cats every year.\r\n\r\nShelter from the Storm is a Madison, WI based non-profit, all breed dog and cat rescue whose mission is to reduce the euthanasia rate of healthy and adoptable animals and to improve the lives of companion animals. \u00e2\u0080\u008b\r\n                  \r\nWe do this by:\r\n  *Finding permanent home for animals in need  \r\n  *Providing support to communities who do not have access to humane organizations\r\n  *Educating the public on responsible pet ownership  \r\n  *Providing access to affordable spay, neuter and veterinary care.

People like you extending your faith in second hand pets is what makes our rescue go round. We depend on adoptions to not only enrich the life of our rescue pet, but to save the life of the next one in line, that we can't take until our babies find their new forevers. We want you to know that your time is very valuable to us and we want our entire process to be done in good faith. We need you to be honest with us and we will be honest with you. Any deception found during the application process will be grounds for denial.\r\n\r\nRequirements: We understand how important your time is and how emotional adding a new pet to the family can be. We are an all volunteer rescue with no paid staff, so we are going to do our best to help you know from the get go if your home environment will be a harmonious fit for what we are looking for in our new adoptive parents. Our checks are extensive, so we ask that you maintain an honest dialogue with us throughout the application. While we believe that any home can become a great one with education, we can not trust applicants that start off on the wrong foot with any untruths during the application process.\r\n\r\nYour current pets need to be fixed. Unless there is a medical issue or compelling reason that your current pets aren't fixed, we will need to pass on your application. Even though our pets are fixed, elevated levels of hormones in existing pets can cause a greater chance of hostility which can lead to fights. A female going into heat can also make recently altered males act out in a way that wasn't anticipated. We want to set each adoption up for success and mixing our stray babies into a home with unaltered pets is not a recipe for success.\r\nYour current pets need to have an active vet history. Monthly preventatives and annual vaccinations are preferred. Some exceptions are made for age and health concerns, but an active history with annual wellness exams are expected. If we feel your current pets aren't taken care of in a manner that we want our babies taken care of, we will pass on your application. If your babies aren't current on their annual exams, please remedy that before placing an application.\r\nYou will need to provide us with a current vet reference or a vet reference from a family member if you are a first time pet owner. We will not be stringent on a familial vet reference, but it will give us a starting place to begin our pet education. We find that children that grow up in families where the pet is treated like one of the family, continue that behavior as they have pets of their own.\r\nYou will need to own your own home or have permission from your landlord to adopt. If we can't get permission from the landowner, we can not place a dog or cat on the property.\r\nOn occasion some of our pets will have specific requirements, and in those cases your home will need to have a provision to accommodate those requirements. Some examples are no children, no cats, physical fence, another dog, no other dogs, etc.\r\nCivility. We require you to treat our volunteers with patience and respect. Our volunteers give their time to these stray babies and to our potential adopters. It is a sad truth that almost everyone wants the cutest puppy and the purebred aussie, but when there is only one of those and ten applications...there are going to be some disappointed applicants. We do the absolute best that we can to match up adoptable strays with adoptive parents in a quick efficient manner, however we do not work on a first come first serve basis. While 8 of the 10 might be approved to adopt with us, we do when possible choose the best match. For example if we have a high energy purebred aussie that loves to play with other dogs, and 2 of those applicants have another dog for it to play with, those would be considered first. Where as if the same dog did not do well with other dogs, the 2 applications with no other pets would be considered first for that situation. At the end of the day no one knows the dog's needs better than the foster, and they will supply input on which family would be the best fit for that particular dog. Other approved applicants would then happily be considered for other dogs in our program that might be a great match for them, if they so desire.\r\nApplication: If you have read the above requirements and feel confident that there are no red flags, we would love for you to become a part of our extended family. This process begins by filling out an application. Click here to fill one out for a dog or a puppy - application!  Click here to fill one out for a cat or a kitten - application!\r\n\r\nApplication Review: Our process begins with a general screening of your application where we try to get a feel for what you are looking for in a new pet and what your current home life is like. In some cases that beautiful puppy that everyone wants might be a holy terror or a breed that is known to be high energy, we try to anticipate pit falls and inform and educate the potential adopter as to whether the pet they think they want is indeed a match. We call references and screen for any red flags that we want to provide additional education on or that might indicate a bad match for our stray babies.\r\n\r\nVet Check: We do require a vet check on all of our applications. When people adopt a puppy from us there is a lot of vet care that needs to be done in the first six months, it is imperative that we can trust the adoptive parents to get everything done on schedule to ensure the health and safety of their new baby. With adults it is just important to us that their new parents will be committed to taking them in every year for a wellness exam to help extend their life to the fullest! For first time pet owners we will work with them to get a family vet reference, whether it's their parents or an extended family member, this helps us find a starting point for any pet education that we will need to impart. There may be times that we feel an adopter is too young or doesn't have a stable enough home environment to adopt from us at the time of the application. \r\n\r\nProperty Review: We will need to know the county you live in so that we can verify your property ownership. If you live with parents or live in a parental home, we will need permission from your parents. If you rent, we will need verbal verification from your landlord or a copy of your lease's pet policy. We absolutely can non put a dog or cat on any property without the permission of the land owner. We will also need to verify any breed restrictions, weight restrictions, number of pets restrictions and any other rules that a community or landlord asks us to comply with. \r\n\r\nConversation: We are on your side! We want to find a great home for one of our stray babies! We will be reaching out to you via phone or email to go over any questions that we might have. We understand that sometimes an application just doesn't cut it, there is no way to put everything down on paper that really shows all of the things that you can offer. Feel free to use this opportunity to further explain any of your application items and to ask us questions. In addition to getting to know you more, this is your opportunity to ask us questions. Adopting a new baby is a huge decision and we want to answer any questions that you may have about the pets that you are interested in before you take time out of your day to attend a viewing.\r\n\r\nDeposit: Most of our puppies and kittens and some of our more popular adults will require a $50 non-refundable deposit to be held for adoption. The deposit will be applied in full to the adoption fee at the time of adoption. This protects those people driving great distances and ensures that their first choice pet is available to them when they arrive. It also protects our fosters who are giving their time and gas money to make a special trip to accommodate a private viewing, from those adoptive parents who change their mind and forget to tell us. If for any reason the stray baby that you had a hold on isn't a perfect fit, you are welcome to transfer your deposit to any other pet in our program (as long as they don't have a special requirement that your application doesn't meet). We aren't out to steal your deposits, we are just limiting holding pets to people who have serious intentions.\r\n\r\nHome Check: Stray Haven will expect for serious adopters to permit us in their home as necessary for home visits and follow ups. Sometimes a volunteer will come before an application approval, sometimes they will come during the meet and greet and sometimes we might schedule a home visit after the adoption to see how things are going. We will make every effort to find a mutually agreeable time. \r\n\r\nMeet & Greet: Once your application is approved and we have answered all of your questions, it is time to arrange a meet and greet! Stray Haven Volunteers will make every effort to meet at a mutually agreeable time. However, with our fosters having limited time between their family, real life jobs and rescue commitments, we will ask our adoptive parents to be flexible on where we schedule the meet and greets. Usually an adoption can be finalized at the time of the meet and greet as long as it's a great match!\r\n\r\nAdoption: Our pets will come with all age appropriate vetting, including spay neuter, microchip, rabies, vaccinations, health tests (heartworm test on dogs and FIV\/FELV in cats), and preventative care such as wormer, flea\/tick & heartworm (dogs only). We require a signed contract promising us that you will take care of your new baby and that you will contact us in the event that you run into a hardship that will prevent you from keeping them. We will accept Cash, Check or Credit Card ($5 fee for CC). Our pets do not come with a crate or a leash.\r\n\r\nAdoption Fees:\r\n\r\nDogs - $175 + $13 Lifetime Microchip Registration, which includes lifetime membership to Pet Lovers Portal with your stray baby's medical history. \r\nPuppies - $175 + $13 Lifetime Microchip Registration, which includes lifetime membership to Pet Lovers Portal with your stray baby's medical history. \r\nCat - $50 + $13 Lifetime Microchip Registration, which includes lifetime membership to Pet Lovers Portal with your stray baby's medical history. \r\nKitten - $100 + $13 Lifetime Microchip Registration, which includes lifetime membership to Pet Lovers Portal with your stray baby's medical history. ","about":"Stray Haven is located in Aurora Indiana, situated in the tri-state area between Cincinnati Ohio, Indianapolis Indiana and Louisville KY. Our pet rescue has a unique two tier goal that focuses on saving stray animals through adoption, education, exposure and sharing of resources.\r\n\r\nOur first mission is to rescue and adopt out homeless pets to amazing homes, plain and simple. We have a foster based program that strives to heal the heart, soul and instill confidence in our abandoned babies. In addition to building up the emotional side of our fosters, we take care of their medical needs. Our pets will come with all age appropriate vetting, including spay neuter, microchip, rabies, vaccinations, health tests (heartworm test on dogs and FIV\/FELV in cats), and preventative care such as wormer, flea\/tick & heartworm (dogs only).\r\n\r\nOur pets come from our Independent Rescue Partners, which comprise our second mission. The second goal is much more complicated and revolves around supporting the front line troops that have eyes on the ground in rural areas of Kentucky. People imagine and share the pain when they hear of dogs and cats dying in an animal shelter, but what most people don't realize is just how many counties don't have access to an animal facility. While any loss is a sad one, having a shelter that feeds and shelters a pet in it's final days provides a bit of hope compared to the horrific end that can befall so many homeless babies.\r\n\r\nThe pet overpopulation issue is well known and widespread but still there is no end in sight for many counties with minimal income, education and resources.  Many counties in our Midwestern and Southern states don't have a county shelter, which means animals get no care or they have holding facilities that contract with other counties to take their homeless pets. The contracted county shelters are almost always overcrowded and taking in the additional animals means additional stresses which lead to frequent euthanasia. Rescues in Kentucky and surrounding states work tirelessly trying to help out the situation but to date it has been a losing battle.\r\n\r\nFor some lucky dogs and cats in those counties with no shelter, they have front line troops, called Independent Rescuers that work tirelessly and on their own dime to shelter them. They start by literally saving the animal, whether hurt on the side of the road, abandoned on mountain tops and coal mines, starving in well meaning residents homes, or forgotten when someone had to relocate, regardless of the situation the Independent Rescuer finds and brings the unwanted pets into their home to provide food and temporary housing. Once the dog is safe from harm they work to facilitate rescue, foster and donations to help with emergency vetting as needed.\r\n\r\nDespite their best efforts, Independent Rescuers can't always secure rescue for the animals that they have in their care. Rescues try their best but at the end of the day there is only so much foster space available and they can't save them all. This conundrum quickly becomes a financial burden on the front line troops, leaving them to feed and vet those that they were unable to find rescue for. Our mission is to support these rescuers through Education, Exposure and the Sharing of Resources to keep their life saving passion alive! While we can take some of their animals, we will never have enough fosters to take them all, so instead we help to secure homes for as many of their babies as we can through exposure via adoption sites in our more populated location.","meetPets":"Adoption events in Florence Ky and Harrison Oh & via private viewings.

We are looking at helping people and pets from Pueblo to Kansas and from Pueblo to New Mexico including the San Louis Valley.   These areas are underserved.  Pueblo Animal Shelter for several years has had one of the highest kill rates in Colorado.  ","adoptionProcess":"When a person wants to adopt an animal they fill out an adoption application.  We do home checks and vet references.  We sit down and get to know potential adopters.  We let them know for any reason the animal doesn't work out or if their lives dramatically changes we will take back the animal. We let people foster to adopt.  Foster based rescues are a new concept in rural Colorado.  Our fees $75 cats, $125 kittens,  $150 puppies, $100 dogs, $50 Pocket Pets ( depends if cages go with them or not)  ","about":"I'm Suzanne, I have worked with rescues for several years.   When the news about our shelter's numbers hit the media it was shocking and devastating that 1:4 animals that gets taken to Pueblo Animal Shelter dies.  That is when I decided to focus on Southern Colorado and be an all inclusive all animal rescue.   I picked the strongest smartest people to sit on my board.  Together we are determined to be part of the solution.\r\nBecause we are foster based we can only save as many animals that we have fosters for. Coops has been in business for only a few weeks.   Purposely we have taken it slow so not to be overwhelming.    \r\nCooper is part of Cooper & Company, my dogs, all are rescued.  I love to write so they have their own FB page.  It was natural to then have Cooper's Companions.\r\nSome say they have a \"once in a life time dog\".  I have been lucky because over my life I have had  10 and many cats.  Each one was and is a once in a life time soul.  \r\nMy goal in the next year is to be a training facility to Read to Me Dogs for our local schools and libraries.  One of our school districts has failed the state standards for 5 years.   The other school district needs help as well.    My local school, the school I went to as a child, is 95% free and reduced lunch, that means 95% of the children going to school are living below poverty level, and some do not speak English.   So two things here.If I can train dogs to come in a listen to children read those children have a chance.  And somewhere down the road when these children become adults they may have a better appreciation for dogs and all animals.\r\nSo why do I do what I do?  I want to help my community by Spay and Neuter clinics, affordable vet clinics, and  putting Read to me Dogs into schools.  ","meetPets":"We are so new that we have had only a few Meet and Greets.

Adoptable cats and kittens are spayed or neutered, receive veterinary care as needed, and are nurtured until a forever and loving home is found. We advocate and support Trap-Neuter-Release Feed (TNRF) programs and work with local veterinarians to provide low spay\/neuter services to those cat owners who are unable to afford medical treatment. Safe Haven 4 Cats SC is dependent entirely on the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generosity through donations. Fundraising efforts and events are initiated with the sole purpose of providing a better quality of life for all cats. \r\nWhat We Do:\u00e2\u0080\u00a8Volunteers educate the public to encourage the spaying\/neutering of cats in order to reduce the senseless number of cats and kittens euthanized daily. \r\nWe provide a low cost spay\/neuter program for anyone needing assistance in getting \r\nferal or friendly cats spayed\/neutered. Spay\/neutering, Rabies vaccination, worming and flea treatment for $45 for male & $55 for females. Testing for FELV\/FIV & FVRCP Vaccinations are provided at a low additional cost and is recommended, but not required. It is recommended that Feral cats are ear-tipped for identification purposes and returned to their colony and is included in cost of spay\/neuter, there is no additional cost. \r\nCats that are suitable for adoption are tested for feline leukemia (FELV) and feline aids (FIV), wormed, provided flea treatment, spayed\/neutered, receive distemper vaccinations, etc., to assure that they are healthy and sociable. If you need help in trapping a feral cat, we can lend you traps and some assistance in trapping. \r\nFoster homes are provided for friendly, domesticated cats and kittens until a permanent honey is found. Volunteers trap and transport feral\/free roaming cats to one of our low cost spay\/neuter clinics where they are sterilized and given their rabies vaccinations. Feral cats are ear-tipped for identification purposes and returned to their colony. Additional medical care is rendered as needed. \r\nFeral colonies are monitored daily by volunteers and provided with fresh food and water so that they remain healthy. \r\nFeral kittens are fostered and nurtured in a loving home in order to acclimate them for adoption. \r\nCats that are in a dangerous or abused and neglected situation are relocated to a safe environment after receiving preventative veterinary care. \r\nOur Goals:\u00e2\u0080\u00a8Safe Haven 4 Cats SC is relentless in protecting the feline population in the Horry County area. Dedicated to reducing the number of unwanted cats and kittens through adoptions, we aim to provide a safe and secure sanctuary where homeless and unadoptable cats will be able to live out their remaining years in a safe and sheltered environment.

","about":"Matty's story:\r\nI started to see Matty's picture posted on the MG Impound Dogs page in late October of 2012.  Matty and his \"mate\", Athena, were in jail for bite quarantine.  They were playing and a lady got scratched by either a tooth or a claw, and they could not determine by which dog.  The owners knew Athena and Fatty (Matty's actual name from owner, Cheryl changed it because he was no Fatty) were there, but they didn't have the funds to pay for fees and vetting. Athena was rescued. From the time I saw Matty's picture, the one where he is sitting on Cheryl's shoes, I knew I needed him. I asked numerous big and small rescues if they would please pull Matty for me.  Their answers were all the same, we have a blue Pit Bull you can adopt.  No, it had to be Matty! Matty's time was coming near and they scheduled a euthanasia date.  I was in tears daily.  Finally, though, last minute, the day before he was to be killed, Amber from One of a Kind Pet Rescue said she would pull him for me!  I was ecstatic!  I picked Matty up from the impound on January 2nd, 2013.  He wasn't perfect, but he was perfect for me...and he didn't become a statistic....he is truly my heart & soul.  He brought Cheyenne and I out of a deep depression over losing Teddy, my Chow Chow, to Lymphoma. Matty started my learning journey into rescue.  I havent been in very long.  I have held many roles ( vetting, intake, foster, events and fundraising coordinator to just name a few) in the rescues I have been in, and I have fostered about 100 puppies. I was blinded, ignorant of all that was happening prior to Matty. My blinders were lifted, Matty and I, with some friends would like to make a bigger impact.  Help more dogs and cats find their second chance at love and life just like Matty did.  Wont you help us?\r\n\r\nMatty's Heart & Soul Animal Rescue.   Mission is to bring hope back to the discarded, abandoned, neglected, and abused dogs and cats, and provide them with all they need in a loving foster family until they find their perfect forever home.

Prospective adopters are encouraged to meet various dogs and to bring all family members and existing pets to meet the dogs they are interested in. Once \u201cthe\u201d dog has been selected, we perform a routine Home Visit to ensure the dog will be safe from any hazards, poisons, or dangerous situations. At this time, we advise the adopter if there are any repairs or corrections that need to be made prior to the dog coming home. Adopters pledge to love and care for the adopted dog throughout its entire lifetime. In the event an adopter is no longer able to care for a dog, we insist it come back into our rescue safety net for re-homing. Due to financial and logistical limitations, we do not place dogs outside of the Southern California area.\r\n \r\nOur minimum Adoption Donation is $350 plus $25.00 for microchip for dogs over 1 year, and $450 plus $25.00 for microchip for dogs one year old and younger.

All available for download on our website.","about":"MISSION STATEMENT    \r\n\r\nTo RESCUE cats from abandonment, provide REHABILITATION when necessary, bring our cats and their humans together in adoption and provide a RETIREMENT sanctuary to those in need.\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nFuRRR Feline Rescue is a nonprofit, no kill, volunteer driven organization in New Hampshire incorporated in 2015.  We specialize in the elderly, special needs and at risk of euthanasia kittens and cats from high kill southern shelters via our southern rescue partners.  We often take cats that are in need of extensive medical care that may otherwise not get the necessary treatment.  Our rehabilitation services include emergency medical care, medicine for chronic conditions and emotional care for traumatized cats.  FuRRR helps our community working with local trappers, taking strays from the streets helping put an end to unwanted animals, as well as taking pets surrendered by their owners for many reasons.  \r\nAll cats in our care are spayed or neutered, receive all appropriate veterinary care and treatment.  Our cats live in cage free communal rooms (except during Intake 48 hour quarantine and Isolation for illness) where they are able to freely roam and socialize with each other and our volunteers.  We also have a network of fosters who care for pregnant females, moms with kittens as well as cats that need medical care multiple times per day and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suited for the rescue.  FuRRR values working with our community, we are partners with local retail stores.    When our cats are healthy, free from behavioral issues, we place them in our adoption network of partner stores.  We showcase our cats in store habitats for better exposure and holding monthly adoption events for quicker adoptions.   Amazing cats join their new families and the public is educated about adopting cats from rescues.\r\nWe provide lifetime sanctuary to cats who may be less desirable to adopting families due to age, chronic illness, behavioral skittishness or special needs.  FuRRR has retirement residents that are\/were 18 & 19 years old that were surrendered when their owners passed away.  Other residents have neurological disorders and many have behavioral issues.  Our volunteers spend extra time with these cats that need special attention.  The geographic area we serve is New Hampshire, southern Maine and northeast Massachusetts.  We have even had an adopter fly from Colorado to adopt a bonded pair of kittens from FuRRR!\r\nWe are dedicated to keeping administrative costs low so that virtually every dollar donated goes directly to the care of our cats.  98% of all money contributed is spent directly in support of animal rescue and rehabilitation, with the remaining 2% supporting administration and fundraising.  We have achieved this with much being paid for by our volunteer Board of Directors.  We have a small but growing group of recurring monthly sponsors.  FuRRR holds online auctions with amazing items donated by our volunteers and supporters.  These auctions are held on our Facebook page and our supporters look forward to them several times per year.  All funds raised benefit our FuRRR cats! When we have cats that come to us with extensive medical needs, we hold online fundraisers on our Facebook page.  We have the most amazing supporters who have helped our cats who needed eye enucleation from severe upper respiratory infections in the shelter, to kittens born with eyelid agenesis who needed reconstructive surgery to provide a functional eyelid, to a stray kitten that was found on the side of the road in the rain who needed liver shunt surgery.  His name is Turtle (because he moved so slowly when found) and over a year after surgery he is a happy healthy kitty! \r\nFuRRR believes in fighting for the voiceless cats that have been abandoned, abused, neglected and forgotten. \r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nAn average of 350 to 400+ cats per year will pass through our rescue.  These cats are moved out of high kill southern shelters and locally as strays or owner surrenders. They are given everything needed for vetting and adopted into safe and loving homes.  For a new rescue our numbers of Intake\/Adoptions from 2015 to 2016 show our rapid growth.  Our social media shows our amazing support from our local community to our national cat rescue community.  FuRRR is dedicated to feline rescue and will steadily provide more services in our local community and with our partner stores as our volunteer base grows. \r\n","meetPets":"We currently partner with PetSmart Rochester, Petco in Rochester and Portsmouth, NH and Pet Connection in Barrington, NH.

During spring and summer, we have seasonal foster parents that help us during the busiest times, taking in litters of tiny sick kittens or pregnant momcats.   We always need more fosters so please contact us if you\u2019re interested in fostering!   Remember even Superman had foster parents.\r\nWe rescue many animals from euthanasia at overcrowded county shelters, as well as taking in orphans and homeless animals found by people on their property, or sadly abandoned in front of stores or on roadsides.   By taking these animals under our wing we alleviate shelter overcrowding and give these animals a chance at a good home.  We foster the animals in our homes, often nursing many of them back to health, then have them spayed\/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated & wormed before putting them up for adoption. \r\n","meetPets":"They are in foster homes, and we hold adoption events at Bennett Valley Pet store and Petco in Santa Rosa on weekends","services":"Animal Rescue","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

There they have a quiet, private space to get to know each other better.

Adopters must also be 18 or older. ","about":"PHS\/SPCA, a private non-profit organization guided by the humane ethic, builds healthy relationships between people and animals. Each year thousands of animals pass through our doors. We provide a warm bed, nutritious food, veterinary care and a gentle touch for the lost, stray, unwanted and injured domestic and wild animals in our community.\r\n\r\nAs an ethical choice to provide safe sanctuary for every animal in need and since we are contracted with all cities in San Mateo County, we have no control over the number of incoming animals. Last year, we received more than 8,500 dogs, cats and other pet animals as well as thousands of sick, injured and orphaned wildlife. We accept all animals, and often provide a second chance to the neediest \u2013 those who would otherwise be turned away at so-called \u201cno kill\u201d agencies that accept only highly adoptable animals. Our record is outstanding. Since 2003, we have adopted 100% of healthy dogs and cats. Our definition of \u201chealthy\u201d is based on the State\u2019s definition: dogs and cats without medical or behavioral issues, fully weaned and social. It excludes obviously unhealthy animals (those with injuries and illnesses or those behaviorally scarred from past treatment and mistreatment) as well as unweaned kittens and feral cats.  Sadly, in some cases like the ones mentioned above, all we can provide is a painless ending when resources have been exhausted.  While we cannot save every treatable animal, we place every healthy animal into a new home. Staff, volunteers and supporters are equally proud of the fact that we make well, then adopt, between 100-150 treatable animals every month.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducational programs, outreach clinics, and partnerships with other organizations bring our services to the many animals who never set paw in our shelter. We hold a monthly support group for those grieving the loss of a loved companion, assist county residents who face the daunting task of finding pet-friendly rental housing, offer multiple levels of obedience classes, offer a speakers bureau, and investigate hundreds of cruelty calls. PHS\/SPCA is much more than a shelter. It's a place where dedicated professionals and volunteers share their passion, talent and commitment in service to the animals and people in the diverse communities that make up San Mateo County. We invite you to learn more about us.\r\n\r\nOur Challenge\r\nDecades ago, The Peninsula Humane Society & SPCA\u2019s biggest challenge was animal overpopulation. The number of incoming unwanted animals was staggering.  In the mid 1970s, we took in 45,000 dogs and cats annually.  Due to our work educating people (including schoolchildren) about the importance of spaying and neutering their pets and, equally important, making spay\/neuter affordable, we now see far fewer incoming animals; around 10,000 dogs and cats each of the last few years. To further drive down this number, we added a mobile spay\/neuter program; we bring our \u201csurgery suite on wheels\u201d into targeted neighborhoods and offer spay\/neuter surgeries for free!  We\u2019re addressing other challenges as well.   \r\n\r\nAnimal cruelty \u2013 We\u2019ve established a Humane Investigations Dept. We intervene when animals are mistreated and present cases to our District Attorney\u2019s Office for prosecution.\r\n\r\nSpecialty care for animals -- Many animals arrive perfectly healthy. Others, however, require extensive medical care or one-on-one work with our Behavior Department staff before they can be placed in a new home. Donations to our Hope Program fund this life-saving work.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisibility \u2013 since we choose to have donations directly benefit animals, we need to be creative in terms of getting our word out. Staff columns in local papers, an active mobile adoption program, several levels of obedience classes, this terrific website, school visits and summer camp, a Speakers Bureau, and an award-winning PSA airing on all network affiliates are among the many ways we expand our community profile.   \r\nFifty Years of Innovation\r\nFor more than 50 years, PHS\/SPCA has been a progressive, often-modeled leader. Our roots trace to a small association of animal advocates who found deplorable conditions at the local pounds and established the Society. Soon thereafter, this new organization contracted with San Mateo County to provide animal control services -- the first such relationship of its kind. In the 1970s, PHS\/SPCA became the first California humane society to have an on-site Spay\/Neuter Clinic, a wildlife rehabilitation center and \"get acquainted\" rooms for the public to meet and play with shelter animals as part of the adoption process. By the late 1970s, the Society began teaching the humane treatment of animals to schoolchildren. In the 1980s, the Society began a mobile adoption program, and in the early 1990s, PHS\/SPCA was among the first shelters to offer sheltering services for pets belonging to domestic abuse victims and a free animal behavior helpline for local pet owners. More recent innovations include a pet assisted therapy program which brings our volunteers and their pets to patients and residents in hospitals and other health care facilities, a department devoted to addressing animal cruelty and a mobile spay\/neuter program which provides free surgeries for residents in targeted neighborhoods.\r\n","meetPets":"Our shelter based in San Mateo CA, is open from 11 am to 7 pm, Monday through Friday. 11 am to 6 pm, Saturday and Sunday.","services":"adoptions, spay\/neuter, wildlife care center, education and animal behavior programs ...","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Next, we would like for you to attend one of our meet n' greets to meet your potential new pup face to face (dates and times will be announced on our Events page). Lastly, we will conduct a home visit and introduction to your family (both human and non-human). Additionally, all of our dogs require an adoption fee.\r\n\r\nThe dogs in the Canine CellMates program are all selected from Fulton County Animal Control, a high-kill facility, which is now under the management of Lifeline Animal Project. Each dog chosen for the program undergoes extensive temperament testing to determine their suitability for the program. Under the supervision of volunteer professional trainers and assistants, the dogs and their handlers spend eight weeks learning basic obedience. Equally important, the dogs are socialized around a variety of people and other dogs during this period.\r\n\r\nCanine CellMates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dogs are available for adoption immediately and will be able to go to their forever homes after graduation. Canine CellMates will carefully screen all adoption applications to ensure the right match between dog and person.\r\n\r\nLike all dogs adopted from FCAS, the Canine CellMates graduates are fully vaccinated, micro chipped, spayed or neutered and are on monthly heartworm prevention.","about":"Canine CellMates began in June 2013 as a dedicated jail dog program in cooperation with the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, GA. Canine CellMates maintains a continuing partnership with the Fulton County Animal Services (FCAS), the Fulton County Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office and the Fulton County Jail, allowing us the opportunity to save dogs from the shelter by vetting them, training them and ultimately transforming them into adoptable dogs, all while benefiting the inmates and the greater community.\r\nOur Mission: Our mission is to provide a better life for both the inmates in the Fulton County Jail and rescued shelter dogs from FCAS. During an intensive 16 week course consisting of education, training and overall care for the dogs, we hope to positively change both the dogs and the inmates. During the 16 week program, an inmate is able to train two dogs, one after the other. At the end of the training course, our goal is for the dogs to pass the Canine Good Citizen test and graduate from our program into a wonderful, forever home. We also aim to provide viable job skills for the inmates and create a new overall lease on life for both the dogs and the inmates.\r\nWhat We Do: All of the dogs selected for our program have undergone extensive temperament testing with our dedicated Behavior Assessment team. Upon arrival at their temporary home in the dormitory style setting within Fulton County Jail, each dog is assigned a primary inmate handler, and on occasion, a secondary handler. This not only allows for more inmates to benefit from the program, it also provides continuity for the dog, should one of the handlers leave the program.\r\n\r\nCertified dog trainers and training assistants conduct the training sessions throughout the 16 week course, using positive training methods to teach the inmates how to train and care for the dogs. Outside of the work in the classroom, the inmates spend time during the day with their dog, bonding and reinforcing the skills learned in class. We also have a strong educational component to our program \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we bring speakers in to talk about issues such as Breed Specific Legislation, Tethering - the dangers and the alternatives, resources like Ahimsa House, and other professionals both inside and outside of the animal rescue community. A common theme is One Person Can Make a Difference. We truly believe that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you know better, you do better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nWhy It Matters: In simple terms, this program changes lives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both canine and human, by offering them a second chance at life. Both groups have faced isolation and rejection by the outside world, but when they come together, they often give each other a new found sense of hope, as they become the rescuer for one another.\r\n\r\nThe benefits to the inmate handlers are many, including: learning responsibility by caring for a living being, accountability in working towards a goal, experiencing the joy of unconditional love, gaining confidence in working toward a positive outcome and skills that will allow them to become law abiding, productive members of society.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of violent outbursts in prison and jail facilities where jail dog programs operate has shown a dramatic decrease, sometimes as much as 50%. Recidivism rates have also shown drastic improvements. The Atlanta metro area has had one of the highest recidivism rates in the country, around 70% within the first two years after release. With programs like this in place, it is likely that the Atlanta metro area will begin to show a reduction in this recidivism rate.\r\n\r\nAt FCAS, 30 to 40 animals in need are added each day to the already overcrowded shelter population. Unfortunately, due to a lack of space, many healthy, adoptable dogs are euthanized. At Canine CellMates, we work in conjunction with FCAS to lower this alarming statistic by providing community outreach, education and forever homes for the Canine CellMate dogs.","meetPets":"Meet n' greets.

As part of the community awareness, we have been the official sponsor of the Euless Animal Shelter for the past six years.  It is our goal to help the shelter adopt pets and find forever homes or fosters so they will not be put down.  We do this through networking, pet adoption sites, and raising funds to lower the cost of spaying\/neutering, in addition to vaccinating the shelter pets for parvo and distemper.  We have also helped with heartworm treatment and various other medical costs of animals in need. Our sponsors visit the shelter at least once a week to update pictures, shots, and check on the dogs and cats.  We take the GAP girls twice a month so they can volunteer and understand why we sponsor pets and have fund-raises. The shelter's euthanasia rate has dropped dramatically since we have been working with them.  We owe a lot of this to networking and the internet. \r\n\r\nI personally get a lot of satisfaction out of working with the shelter and the animals because the animals can't help themselves and they seem so genuinely grateful when you give them even just the littlest bit of attention and love.

As of December 2008, our organization no longer held the contract to run the local animal shelter, and with that change in direction, we have been able to approach the animal community in a completely different direction.  \r\nAlthough operations have changed our mission has not.  The Texarkana Animal League exists to provide protection and care for abandoned, abused, neglected and unwanted companion animals. We also want to promote animal welfare through programs and services that mutually benefit animals and people.\r\nWe have been able to use our annual fundraiser, the \u201cTails of Two Cities\u201d Day Planner to start three community-based programs.  One helps low income households spay and neuter their pets and another helps current rescuers with medical costs of special needs animals. Finally, we established a foster care program to pull needy animals from the community, as well as the shelter, which will provide the extra medical attention and socialization needed in order for the animal to become adoptable.  \r\n\r\nlow income, Spay\/Neuter Assistance Program. Along with altering the companion animal, we have included a wellness check, vaccines, and a heartworm test.

Prices have been negotiated for the different procedures, but the cost remains the same to the public. \r\n\r\nAll of our adoptable animals are spayed\/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, microchipped, and on flea\/tick\/heartworm prevention.\r\n\r\nThese items will take an animal from no or nominal care to complete care and will make them highly adoptable.

All adoptions are followed up on a periodic basis to assure that PYRescue standards are met.\r\n\r\nAll potential new guardians must meet with PYRescue personnel and the Pyrenees considered for adoption. Wherever possible the adoptive Pyrenees and other family dogs are also introduced in neutral territory. In the final analysis, the adoptive Pyrenees must be willing to go with the prospective new guardian. If the Pyrenees hesitates or refuses to go the whole adoption is off (we have had several instances of this and if the Pyr does not want to go we find another acceptable home for that Pyr). In general, many of the rescued Pyrenees have been family pets before coming to PYRescue for adoption. If at all possible, they are placed in a pet-oriented family home. However, the ever growing need to find homes has caused PYRescue to place Pyrs also in ranch\/farm oriented environments, especially as related to small llama and sheep herds. This approach appears to be working well in situations where the new owners are prepared to be both patient and compassionate towards the Pyr in relation to his\/her new environment.\r\n\r\nPYRescue also develops and publishes various educational documents related to the guardianship and care of the Great Pyrenees.","about":"A Sanctuary for Pyrenees while awaiting Adoption\r\nWho are these folks, and why are they helping these beautiful dogs?\r\n\r\nThis is the puppy that started us on our journey to help these great dogs - Nichole\r\n\r\nJohn and Linda Kryder started by adopting their first Pyr puppy, & Nichole, in 1992. In learning to live with a little Pyr, they got involved with the Great Pyrenees Club of America, participated in the activities of a regional group and eventually became involved in the group's rescue program. One thing led to another and in 1994 they separated from the club and formed PYRescue. They incorporated and became a nonprofit 501(c)3 in 2011. On an average, they rescued two Pyrs a week, placing over 2500 Pyrenees in new homes over the years.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2015, they finally decided to retire and turned the reins over to new owners and operators Judith Dole and Dr. Michael Heffron, who bought a large property just a few miles northeast of the Kryders in 2014. Michael and Judy built a new facility designed specifically for the needs of these big, beautiful dogs, which can be seen on our Facilities page The Pyrs who are awaiting placement now have a 4 acre fenced pasture to run and play in, 150 square foot indoor\/outdoor heated and cooled kennels with large comfy beds and blankets.\r\n\r\nTax-deductible donations pay for food, utilities, transportation expenses, and vet bills.\r\n\r\nPlease consider sponsoring a Pyr that we are currently sheltering, or if you would like to make a donation to help these wonderful animals, contact us or use the credit card or Paypal link on our homepage.\r\nOur Mission\r\n\r\nThe mission of PYRescue is to provide for the continuing care and support of all Great Pyrenees in need of assistance through no fault of their own.  PYRescue shall continue to provide all necessary care; medical (including spay\/neuter without exception), physical and emotional, as required to ensure the placement of every homeless and unwanted Pyrenees that comes to PYRescue in a permanent, happy, and loving home environment suitable to the needs of each Pyrenees.

Animal Rescue.  We have our paws in many projects for Southern Missouri Dogs.  In addition to our Foster Care Program for homeless dogs to seek adoption into forever homes, our sister site www.petfinder.com\/shelters\/MO207.html is our Safety Forum.  This site features dogs in our communities.  These dogs are not in foster care but remain in their original situation.  Ozark Haven is part of a huge network and often the dogs in the Safety Forum are seen by other rescues and find safety.  In our continued work with CARE, a Not for Profit Homeless Dog Transport we can offer SO MO dogs a chance to reach populations where they arent as common and have better adoption potential.  Dogs that live rurally in the forest communities of Southern Missouri dont have municipalities or other agencies to help them.  They often burden the hillsides and face horrible violent fates.  Our Safety Forum provides those dogs fair and equal web exposure to find safe screened options for life!!  \r\n\r\nOur Dominicks Honor program addresses the deadly practice of tethering.  People will tie anything around a dogs neck.  Our local rural administrations are not concerned with the deadly act of tethering.  As a charity we cannot lobby but we sure can offer light weight harnesses and cables to improve the life of dogs that are tethered.  While sharing the gift of painless tethering, we always offer our Safety Forum services in hopes of moving these dogs to a home with appropriate care practices.  \r\n\r\nOur Littering the Ozarks Program has been a successful one, we plan to build on this in the New Year.  We will offer screened placement of unwanted litters in the community if the owners of the mother will consent to allow us to spay her.  This program has been well received in our communities and is a targeted program for growth in 08.  \r\n\r\nAnd finally, our Feral Dog Project MO.  Feral dogs are a symptom of \"dumping\".  Abandonment plaques our communities.  With limited options for unwanted pets, dumping on a country road is common place.  The survivors of these dumpings often find disease, starvation, conficts with wildlife and violent deaths are their only reward.  The strongest survivors may be a natural enemy to fielded livestock, chickens or local small game such as rabbits and squirrels, at which time they become hunted themselves.  They threat our farmers and burden our food chain.  Feral Dog Project MO supports the use of humane trapping, rehabbing and placement of these dogs.  In the future we hope to build a compound for feral dogs that will not make human companions. Here they could continue to live \"wild\" but with safety and care.  These would be the exception as many is the time these lost terrified souls make wonderful pets!!

We wear many hats in the world of animal rescue and have found that the initial and primary obstacle in saving the lives of Border Strays is to provide them with vet care (often emergency vet care), medicine, food, supplies, and boarding. As such, this organization was formed primarily to bridge the gap between getting Border Strays off the streets, taking care of emergency and\/or initial vet care, and getting them into a safe environment until a rescue or a permanent home can be found. Once a family or rescue agrees to take the animal, then logistics are formed and transportation arrangements are made. \r\n\r\nCrossing Guardians also provides food and supplies to independent rescuers south of the border, or will wire funds so they can procure those items themselves. Crossing Guardians helps with boarding costs, including rental payment of homes used as a temporary haven for homeless animals until placed with a rescue or permanent home.\r\n\r\nMexico is Southern California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighboring country, but animal rescue is made more difficult because it is still another country. So, with each animal rescue venture, a cooperative alliance is formed with other individuals, both north and south of the border. It is always a team effort with many players involved.\r\n\r\nThrough our collective endeavor to make a positive contribution for the stray animal population along the California-Mexico border, we hope to make a fundamental change in the current assumption that animals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter.","meetPets":"We will travel to the homes of potential adopters.","services":"Rescue, foster care, adoptions, veterinary care sponsorships","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Whenever possible, our foster parents work with these animals to rehabilitate them and qualify them for adoption to good homes.\r\nThere is no set limit to the length of time an animal can remain in our adoption program. As long as we have space, and the pet appears to be able to maintain good physical and emotional health in our kennel environment (or foster home), the pet will remain in our program.\r\nEvery animal, however long it remains in our adoption program, is guaranteed a clean, safe, comfortable space, nutritious food and fresh water, medical supervision and, when needed, care and supplies, as well as interaction with volunteers who groom, exercise, and socialize with them.\r\nWe do our best to move young puppies and kittens and other special-needs animals into foster care, where they remain until they are ready for adoption. We also work with breed-specific groups to find homes for some animals, in order to maintain space within our own shelter. We do everything in our power to avoid the euthanasia of healthy animals, or of animals who can be rehabilitated or go to homes that will provide care for a lifetime. We are able to find new homes for the great majority of our pets and appreciate your continued support as we push towards a low-kill community. To reach this goal, we are working to create not a no-kill shelter, but a low-kill community where all adoptable animals are able to find forever loving homes. These are the steps we are taking to achieve that effect:\r\nMaintain a widespread effort to promote spaying and neutering of all companion animals\r\nContinually increase the number of shelter animals that are adopted to new homes through our programs.\r\nEncourage responsible pet ownership through public-awareness campaigns, humane education programs, and efforts to legally eliminate puppy mills and backyard breeders\r\nSupporting pet owners through training classes, counseling, and referrals to outside information sources\r\nThe Humane Society of Kent County Maryland, Inc is a private, charitable 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

We do not have a shelter or boarding facility, but instead rely upon foster homes to shelter and nurture our furry friends until a loving forever home is found.

We realized there was a serious need for rescues willing to work specifically with this Animal Control facility, and this county. The shelter is very small and rural. Some days the shelter sees intakes of 30+ dogs and cats, who get anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks to get adopted before they have to be euthanized for space. Not only do we take in the dogs on their last day, but we also take in starving, abused, injured, and senior dogs from the shelter and local community. We are 100% foster based at this time, although our goal is to eventually have a facility. We believe that all dogs deserve a chance at a warm, safe home, regular meals, basic vet care, and love and affection. Because of this, we take in dogs that need emergency medical care, heartworm positive dogs, seniors in need of hospice care, and hard to adopt out breeds, such as Bully breeds. \r\n\r\nPlease consider adopting, fostering, donating, and sharing our page to help us continue to save dogs in our community.

The Application can be found at the Adoption drop-down menu on the navigation bar above or by clicking here:  Echo Dogs Application Form\r\n\r\nThe application is sent electronically to our processing team, where references are checked.  (Yes, we really do call your references!)\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nWe will call and speak with references listed on your application.  The information provided to us by your references is kept strictly confidential.  We believe that we get honest information by assuring references that we will not disclose to anyone the content of our conversations.\r\n\r\nYou should call your references to let them know that they may be contacted by Echo Dogs.  Occasionally, we have encountered some references, such as veterinarians, who are reluctant to speak with us unless they have your permission.  It is easier for all of us if you let them know to expect our call.\r\n\r\nNo application can be approved without veterinary and personal references.\r\n\r\nHOME VISIT\r\n\r\nAfter your application has passed through the reference checks, we will work to get a home visit set up.  Either an Echo Dogs volunteer or someone who has agreed to help us (usually another rescue group or animal shelter volunteer) will contact you to set up the home visit.  We will contact you to let you know who will be working with you to find a mutually-convenient time for conducting the home visit.\r\n\r\nHome visits are not scary!!  This is often the most nerve-wracking part of our application approval process -- but it needn't be.  The home visit is designed to accomplish three main goals:  1.  To verify that the information provided on the application is true and accurate; 2.  To determine whether the home has the ability to provide a safe, loving environment for a dog through Echo Dogs; and 3.  To help determine the personality of the dog that would best suit the home and family.\r\n\r\n \r\nMATCHING DOGS\r\n\r\nAfter your application has passed all reference checks and the home visit, you are approved to adopt one of our dogs!  However, not every dog is appropriate for every home.  We will work with you to find the dog that is best suited for your home, family and lifestyle.  We want you to get a dog that will enrich your life and delight you and we want each one of our dogs to have a home and family that thinks he or she is the absolute best dog on the planet. \r\n\r\nOur Adoption Coordinator takes over at this point in the process.  She will look at your application and home visit report and will send your application to the foster home that has a dog she thinks you might be interested in.  The foster home will either call or e-mail you with some information about the dog.  You should ask as many questions as you feel necessary to understand whether this dog is the \"one\" for you.  If you don't think one sounds just right, just let the foster home or the Adoption Coordinator know and we will look for a different dog.  If you can tell us why a particular dog didn't appeal to you, it will help us look at other dogs in our program that might be more suitable.\r\n\r\nPlease do not feel pressured to adopt any dog that you aren't absolutely comfortable about adopting!  Each of us loves our foster dogs, but we realize that he or she might not be the right dog for every family or home.  We do not feel offended or hurt if you decide you would rather adopt a dog other than our personal foster dog.  After all, our goal is to get our foster dog into a home where she or he will be truly treasured.\r\n\"I WANT THIS DOG...\"\r\n\r\nWhen you have found the dog that you want to adopt, let the foster home or the Adoption Coordinator know and the Adoption Coordinator will work with you to finalize the adoption.\r\n\r\n\"...BUT HE'S SO FAR AWAY\"\r\n\r\nWe understand that our dogs are often in places far away from the adopters.  Depending on the distances involved, we have various options available, which we can discuss prior to finalize the adoption.  Bear in mind, that the transportation, depending on the distances involved, the speed with which you want to receive the dog and sometimes just plain luck, may involve some additional expense and almost always require you to drive some distance to pick up the dog.\r\n \r\n\r\nDONATION\r\n\r\nWe ask for each of our adopters to make a minimum donation to Echo Dogs to adopt one of our dogs.  Currently, we request a minimum of $300, which is roughly equivalent to the average veterinary expenses we spend on our dogs.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\r\n\r\n \r\nEach of our dogs, at the time of adoption, will be current on their vaccinations (DHPP, rabies and bordatella), have a negative heartworm test and fecal exam, will have been spayed or neutered and have a microchip implanted.  We keep each of our dogs on Heartgard or Interceptor and Frontline Plus while in foster care. \r\n\r\nMany of our dogs have received considerably more medical treatment than the above, depending on what they need when they arrive into foster care.  If a dog has a chronic condition that is diagnosed while in our care, we will inform you of the diagnosis and the course of treatment that the dog has been receiving while in our care. \r\n\r\n \r\nWHEN IN DOUBT, JUST ASK\r\n\r\nWe gladly answer any questions about our process, or any of our dogs.  Just ask! ","about":"How We Work\r\n\r\nWhere we get our dogs:\r\n\r\nMost of our dogs come from animal control facilities (also known as dog pounds or \"doggie jail\").  They have either been found as strays or abandoned there by their prior owners.  We also accept dogs directly from owners who no longer want them - most of the time, it's due to a change in their family circumstances and they find that the dog simply no longer fits into their plans, but sometimes it's truly an unfortunate set of events that require them to relinquish a beloved pet.\r\n\r\nHow do we choose which dogs we accept:\r\n\r\nThere are three main criteria we use to determine which dogs come into our organization for rehoming. \r\n\r\nFirst, and most importantly, is the temperament of the dog.  In an ideal world, this would be the only criteria we would apply to accepting a dog for rehoming.  We try to get as good a behavioral assessment as we can prior to committing to taking the dog.  If a dog is still with its owner, we require that the dog be assessed by a professional selected by us before we will agree to accept the dog. \r\n\r\nSecond, whether we have an open foster space available.  This, sadly for many dogs, is simply a matter of lucky timing.  We have no physical facility, so we have to wait for a dog to be adopted before we have a foster space available (although we dream of having a facility some day).  Foster space is definitely the bottleneck in our ability to save more dogs. \r\n\r\nThird, if we have a way to get the dog transported from where it is to where the foster home is located.  We sometimes have a dog in one state, but the open foster space is in a different state. If we have volunteers to help transport, we have to incur expense to board the dog for at least two weeks, get its vaccinations and have a health certificate issued in its home state before we transport the dog across into another state for fostering.  If we have the funds and volunteers available, we can save the dog.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhere are the dogs located:\r\n\r\nOnce a dog enters our program, he or she lives in a foster home. Our foster homes are in many different states.  The dog lives as a member of the foster family until he or she is adopted.   The foster parents learn all about the dog and can give potential adopters a detailed description of the dog's personality and quirks.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps us going:\r\n\r\nWE LOVE PHOTOS AND UPDATES!  Hearing that our dogs are doing well and that you're happy with them is what keeps us going in this otherwise fairly grim business.  Please keep us posted on significant events or just whenever you happen to think of it.

We rescue animals from all over the state of California as well as complete full scale rescues all over the country as well as over seas.","adoptionProcess":"  Adoption Procedures:\r\n\r\nOur mission is to find the best possible homes for the animals in our care. Many of them have been through severe hardship, mistreatment or neglect, and that makes it even more important that we do our best for them. This means that we have to have guidelines because not every adopter is right for every animal. We try to do right by every person who comes our way looking for a new family pet. But sometimes we have to say \u0093no\u0094 to a potential adopter. Our animals do not have a say in where they go; since we speak for those who have no voice, we must do it well. Our rejection of an adoption application is no reflection on the adopter. Everyone who wants to adopt an animal from a shelter or rescue group is special because they open their homes to those in need. But, while we try to meet the needs of everyone, our clients are the animals. They have no one else. We appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\n  Get acquainted: We recommend spending no less than an hour of one-on-one time; this helps to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n    Housing Requirements: If you rent, we require a copy of your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to have the animal you are interested in.  This letter needs to be on your landlord's letterhead, and with appropriate contact information to verify the pets-allowed policy.\r\n\r\n    Bring your existing dog(s) if you are adopting another one:  We want to make sure your existing pet loves your new friend as much as you do. Meeting on neutral territory will make the selection and introduction process that much easier.  Please do not bring your own dog(s) into the building; this would put them at risk of exposure to communicable diseases.  If you have cats at home, we will do a cat test with our feline shelter residents.  Often dogs in a new environment will not display a prey drive towards cats during the first couple of weeks of acclimation; this test is only meant to indicate to us an immediate failure if the dog shows aggression.\r\n\r\n     All family members and\/or roommates must meet the animal: Some small children are allergic to cats or dogs, but their parents are not aware of it yet. Some elderly family members can't handle the size or activity level of some of our canine guests. Some animals get along perfectly with one person, yet may act aggressive toward another.  Bringing everyone who will be a part of the family or the household is critical to the success of the adoption.  Please note that we do not adopt animals out to anyone under the age of 21.\r\n\r\n    A home check may or may not be required: Each adoption process will vary due to the needs of the particular animal and background of the applicant. If a home check is needed, we will set up a convenient time to meet with you at your home.\r\n\r\n    The adoption process: We do not start adoption processes within an hour of closing, and we do not hold animals.  The paperwork itself takes just a few minutes, but the adoption process could last up to 1-2 hours depending on the animal you want to take home and the availability of an adoption counselor. During busier times, especially such as weekends, there can be many adoptions in progress; we ask for your patience if you have to wait during this step as we only have a limited number of staff.  If you are adopting a cat, you will need to bring a carrier.\r\n\r\n   Adoption fees: Kittens under 6 months of age are $150; all other cats are $110.  Puppies under 1 year of age are $300; dogs over 1 year are $200, senior dogs are $150.  Fees can only be paid by check, cash, or debit card; we do not allow payment plans and we cannot take credit cards.  (NOTE: Only an amount over the adoption fee is tax deductible).  \r\n\r\nAll dogs in Santa Cruz County are required by law to be licensed; fees start at $28 for one year. License fees should be paid with a separate check made out to SCCASA.  Adoption fees are NOT refundable.\r\n\r\n ** The Santa Cruz SPCA reserves the right to deny ANY adoption for ANY reason ** \r\n\r\nAll of our animals must be spayed \/ neutered before they go home. \r\n\r\nIf they are not already altered, you will be able to pick your new pet up within a few days.\r\n\r\nPlease note that most of the animals in our center come to us with unknown medical histories.  The Santa Cruz SPCA makes every effort to adopt out only healthy animals; however, we cannot guarantee the health of the animal you decide to adopt. ","about":"The purpose of the Santa Cruz SPCA is to ensure the best possible quality of life for animals and to promote respect and reverence for all. Our mission is to strive to prevent cruelty to animals, to stop pet overpopulation, to promote community responsibility and for the humane care, treatment and well-being of all animals through adoption, education, information, and action.\r\n\r\nThe SPCA got its start thanks to Dr. Charles Edward Graves, who graduated from a San Francisco veterinary college in 1901 and was the first veterinarian in Santa Cruz County to treat small animals.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, he donated his land to the Santa Cruz SPCA. In 1955 the Santa Cruz Animal Welfare Association was incorporated. Alva Enberg, founder, was also its first executive director.\r\n\r\nWhen the Santa Cruz County Animal Services Authority was formed in 2002, they took over the animal control contract with the county of Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz SPCA became a private agency, focused on humane education, animal rescue, and community support.  As a result of the SPCA's shift from a public-funded service to private agency, the only funding they receive is in the form of private donations.","meetPets":"The Animal Rescue Center is located at:\r\n2685 Chanticleer Avenue\r\nSanta Cruz, CA 95065\r\n\r\nTues thru Fri: 11-6\r\nSat & Sun: 11-5\r\n*Closed Mondays*\r\n\r\nThe Adoption Center & Gift Shop is located at:\r\nCapitola Mall\r\n1855 41st Avenue\r\nCapitola, CA 95010\r\n(in the Sears wing)\r\n\r\nFri: 11-5:30\r\nSat & Sun: 11-4:30\r\n*Closed Monday - Thursday*\r\n","services":"Adoption, Free Food Bank, Humane Education.

Once the application passes the initial screening, it is forwarded to the foster for further review and reference checks.  Applications must be approved by both an FPC and the foster.  We do our best to process applications and inform the adopter of a decision within 24 hours barring extenuating circumstances. ","about":"Another organization, Operation Fancy Free, had been the sole organization benefiting cats in our county since 2013.  Operation Fancy Free's primary mission was TNR, but they also had a rescue\/foster\/adopt program along with it.  The decision was made in July of this year (2018) to close OFF's foster program and for the organization to refocus solely on TNR.  Several OFF volunteers, including myself, were primarily involved with OFF's rescue\/foster\/adopt program and wanted to continue to provide a rescue\/foster\/adopt program for cats in our county.  Although we know TNR is important, we have a passion for helping existing cats that have been the victims of abandonment, neglect, and abuse find a better life.  As a result, we split from OFF, recruited a few friends, and founded our own organization to focus on that aspect of feline welfare in our county.","meetPets":"By appointment only (we don't have a facility and all cats are in a network of private foster homes).","services":"adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

She bottle fed them and found them homes, she fed all of the strays in our back yard, and it was normal to me! As I became old enough to have my own home, I too took in kittens and stray cats, bottle feeding the ones who needed it and spaying\/neutering them and finding them homes. Then one day my husband and I decided it was time to get our young kids a dog, as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cchase\u00e2\u0080\u009d game they were trying to play with the cats wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really going well. I set out to find a (singular) dog but what I found was LOADS of dogs. I thought it would be hard to find a dog to meet our requirements, good with kids, cats and other dogs, housebroken, crate trained, but no, there were so many perfect, homeless dogs. We adopted 4 dogs in the following 5 months and I finally started fostering dogs for established rescues so that I could keep saving them without owning them. Along with fostering, I brought in a stray here and there, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take in a dog for a family that could no longer keep them and I found so much joy taking these sweet souls in and then finding them their forever home, that I decided to start my own rescue. Charming Pet Rescue is named from our first rescue dog who was named Charming. He had health issues we knew about when we adopted him, and he is now over the Rainbow Bridge but his legacy will live on as we help other wonderful pets in need find their forever homes!\r\nAll of our dogs are INDOOR dogs and they have no idea that they are foster dogs, they all feel right at home here. I am able, thanks to my wonderful and supportive husband, to be a stay at home mom with our 2 beautiful, young children so the dogs first and foremost MUST be good with kids. I take great pride in the fact that our dogs are good, family dogs. Since they live indoors with us, they are either housebroken or in the process of being housebroken. We have indoor kennels set up, where the dogs stay when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not home and at night, so our dogs are crate trained. We have several indoor\/ outdoor cats so I can say for sure if a dog is okay, good or great with cats. We have guests, and play dates, so I can tell you how each dog reacts to many different situations. I always reveal both good and \u00e2\u0080\u009cneeds work\u00e2\u0080\u009d traits of the dogs to potential adopters. My goal is to find a perfect fit for the dogs with a family, so honesty is always my policy.\r\nOur dogs are spayed\/ neutered, vaccinated, microchipped and heartworm tested before adoption and the fee is $150. An adoption application and contract is required for all adoptions and Charming Pet Rescue reserves the right to deny any adoption for whatever reason they see fit. The trial period, for a full refund of your adoption fee is one week from the date of adoption. I will ALWAYS take my pets back but past the first week, the adoption fee will be considered a donation and is nonrefundable.\r\n","meetPets":"Www.charmingpetrescue.com\r\nWww.adoptapet.com\r\nWww.petfinder.com","services":"Spay\/Neuter, Vaccinations, Microchip, heartworm test","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Once approved, we schedule a home visit, where an adoption representative takes the dog to the adopter's home to see if the dog is a good fit for the family and other pets, as well as verify the home is a safe environment for the dog. If everyone feels the dog is a good fit, a contract is signed, adoption fee is paid, and the family takes possession of the dog, unless other arrangements are made.

Founded in 2013 to rescue and rehabilitate Pit Bulls & other \"bully breeds\", we have since adopted out over 1600 dogs, and currently have around 115 adoptable dogs in over 60 foster homes. The majority of our dogs come from high kill shelters, where they are quite literally on death row. We focus on dogs who are deemed \"unadoptable\" at the shelters due to injuries, illness, because they are scared, or simply because of their breed. \u00e2\u0080\u008bWe try to focus on our local animal shelter, but will transport dogs from other counties when we have available fosters. We are currently the only rescue pulling pit bulls from our local shelter. Our Board of Directors is 2 very dedicated women who do not receive any payment for what they do. They each have a house full of difficult dogs that they take because no one else will. They work tirelessly to correct behavior to get them ready for their forever homes. We have a network of fantastic volunteers who foster, transport, perform adoptions, help with our rescue sites, and do all the other necessary things to keep the rescue running. We rely on donations and adoption fees to pay for everything our dogs need.","meetPets":"We hold adoption events periodically where people can meet our dogs, and these are posted on our website, but otherwise we require that potential adopters fill out an application and be approved to adopt before we can arrange a meet and greet.","services":"Adoptions, collaborate to provide spay\/neuter clinic through Rascal Unit","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Completion of an adoption application does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt the specific pet you applied for, nor are you obligated to adopt by completing an adoption application.

Built in 1991, the original facility's sole purpose was to serve as a \"pound\" for stray animals in Mahaska County. As with most animal impound facilities, animals that were not adopted or claimed after 7 days were euthanized. Since then, the SMAS has evolved beyond the old \"pound\" ideology.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nOUR MISSION: The mission of the Stephen Memorial Animal Shelter is to serve as a community resource for pets and people, dedicated to enhancing the welfare of all companion animals\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2011, the SMAS stopped euthanizing animals for space and started looking for alternatives to euthanasia. Through partnerships with other shelters and breed rescues, as well as programs aimed at increasing the adoption rate of the animals in their care, the SMAS went from a dismal live release rate of 40% (meaning 40% of the animals taken in leave the shelter alive) to a live release rate of 93%. In may of 2014, we celebrated our first month of a 100% live release rate, a milestone we are very proud of. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe SMAS is NOT a no-kill shelter, yet we are still able to maintain a euthanasia rate of less than 8%.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to taking in and re-homing stray, abandoned, abused, and otherwise homeless animals, the SMAS, in partnership with the Mahaska Humane Society, has developed programs aimed to educate the community and promoting responsible pet ownership. Some of these programs include visits to the elementary school to teach dog bite prevention, bringing dogs to the local university during finals week as stress relief for students, visiting nursing home and retirement facilities for \"pet therapy\", and helping low-income residents of Mahaska County get their pet spayed\/neutered through our \"Spay the County\" program.","meetPets":"The public can visit our adoptable pets at the Stephen Memorial Animal Shelter any time during normal business hours.

We don't do same day adoptions because we feel that both the dog and the family have to be cohesive. That comes with talking to references, talking to your vet, meeting all the residents in the home, both human and animal alike. We want our dogs to be happy in their new homes and our adoption process allows that. While you can't take one of our dogs home the same day, we promise, it will be worth the wait! \r\nOur process is simple, but sometimes takes a few days. If you are interested in a certain dog, please contact us for an application. Adoption applications do not bind you to a dog or our rescue. They just answer some simple questions such as \"do you have a fenced yard\" and lists your references. A meet and greet is usually done at our weekend adoption events, at the foster home or sometimes at your home. We ask that you bring all the members of the family that will live with the dog, including other dog siblings. We want to see how you interact with the dog and answer all your questions. After the meeting, if you would like to adopt the dog, I will call your references, do a background check and speak to your veterinarian. \r\nNext is a home visit, where we will check out the yard, your fence and observe the environment that the dog will live in. We will make suggestions to help the dog transition better. We usually bring the dog with us to the home visit and if all works out, will leave them with you that day. This usually takes about an hour. At the home check, you will complete the adoption contract that is required to adopt one of our dogs. You will also be asked to pay the adoption fee. \r\nIf for any reason the dog is not working out in your home, it must come back to the rescue. However, the adoption fee and any costs that you have incurred during the ownership of the dog are not refunded.\r\n","about":"Smidget Rescue specializes in finding homes for dogs under 25 pounds.

These dedicated groups typically rely solely on volunteers that work tirelessly trying to save as many animals as they possibly can. Unfortunately, these groups often lack the funding, time and resources to better accomplish their work.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that hit Fernando the hardest was realizing that although the dogs staying at shelters were physically cared for, their mental health deteriorated daily. With each day a dog spends in an animal shelter, his chances for adoption decline due to the psychological effects of the typical shelter environment.\r\n\r\nIt\u0092s not the animal shelter\u0092s fault \u0096 they do the best they can with what they have. The problem is that they have so little available to them to make any kind of change, and that\u0092s why The FernDog Rescue Foundation was formed.\r\n\r\nThe mission of The FernDog Rescue Foundation is to help dogs at risk by providing foster homes that will nurture their physical and emotional health, help locate the ideal forever homes for them while providing support and training to help assure that their stay in their new homes is permanent. In addition we focus on developing programs to promote pet adoption services and raise public awareness by providing community education of the issues surrounding animal rescue.\r\n\r\nWe are a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.","meetPets":"Adoptable pets can be visited at our adoption events as well as at the foster's home or applicant's resident upon application approval.

About 75% are adoptable - we find them homes. Others are feral (wild) cats who have had no positive contact with humans. They, too, have good lives at Thundering Paws. Our foster home network helps us care for many more animals than can stay at the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nSome animals arrive fearful and cannot be adopted until they learn what it's like to be touched by gentle hands. Others need time to recover from injuries or illness before they go to their new homes.\r\n\r\nWhile spay\/neuter is the only permanent solution to the overpopulation of companion animals, Thundering Paws wants animals who are already born to have full, happy lives. That is why we are a no-kill facility.\r\n\r\nWe are a 501(c)(3) organization. All donations to Thundering Paws are tax deductible. We rely on our volunteers and generous donors to keep us going.","meetPets":"Thundering Paws has several cats and kittens up for adoption at the PetSmart near the Hill Country Galleria in Bee Cave.

As a result, these wonderful misunderstood dogs wind up in shelters. We understand what drives these dogs, we can place them appropriately. Our mission is to educate people and save dogs. We do it because we love these dogs, with a little effort, can give them a good new life. Euthanasia is not the solution to out animal overpopulation issue.

It's hard not to fall in love with their fluffy coats and gorgeous eyes, it's hard not to laugh at their antics and marvel at their independent intelligence.  But with the fur comes the shedding, with the antics comes possible destruction and with the independence and intelligence comes a rather nomadic Houdini of a dog that wants to escape and run for the fun of it.  Often these dogs are adopted by people who are not prepared for the very traits they were attracted to.  Some husky owners are not prepared for the amount of energy these dogs have and the exercise they require.  They are intelligent, but often easily bored and not easy to train, they can be stubborn and mischievous.

","about":"Anarchy Animal Rescue was founded in Dec of 2010 out of need and desire to help address two major animal crises in this country - unwanted adoptable pets and the mistreatment and abuse of animals due to puppy mills. Our goal is to find good loving homes for as many pets as we can take in, care for medically and place in responsible homes. After years of working in various animal shelters and fostering and volunteering with local rescue groups, we decided the time has come to do on our own what we do best - save lives! Every year millions of homeless adoptable pets are surrendered to kill shelters across the country. The majority of those animals are put to death due to overcrowding of these shelters. This overcrowding is caused by people purchasing animals from pet stores or breeders and by not spaying or neutering their pets. Every time a person buys a pet or allows their pet to breed, perfectly adoptable dogs and cats are killed in a shelter. It is a vicious cycle and can only be stopped with education, outreach and adoption. If everyone adopted their pets from shelters or rescue groups, there would be less euthanasia in our city pounds. When shelters are overcrowded we are called in to help. By us taking shelter pets into our rescue, we open up cages so the shelters have room for other animals that are coming in resulting is less animals being put to sleep.\r\n\r\nPuppy mills are mass breeding farms created for the sole purpose of profit. The dogs in puppy mills are considered 'product', not living breathing animals. 99% of pet stores across the country obtain their puppies from these mills.\r\nThe parents of these pet store puppies suffer horribly living\r\nin cages until they no longer produce quality puppies. At that point they are killed in a horrific manor, unless we step in to help. We are able to take some of these breeding dogs into our rescue, rehabilitate them, treat them for any medical issues they may have, spay\/neuter them and find them loving home. Most of these mill dogs do not know the true joys of being a dog as they have lived in cages their entire lives.\r\n\r\nWe cannot act alone and we are always in dire need of donations, volunteers, foster homes and adopters. Without those things we would not be able to continue doing what we do!!\r\n\r\nAnarchy Animal Rescue is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization and a proud member of Best Friends Animal Society!","meetPets":"Animals are met by appointment only, and on a case by case basis.

In most situations, an animal need not be removed from its home. Education is the key to successful pet ownership and the prevention of future inhumane treatment of animals. Adoption volunteers find homes, both through individual appointments and at our open houses for domestic animals brought into custody by our state-licensed humane investigators and dedicated volunteers. \r\n\r\nHumane education is vital to animal welfare. We offer speakers to schools, adult and children's groups, and individuals requesting information. \r\n\r\nOur public relations volunteers give us important contacts with the media and allow us to reach out to a growing number of people. We also have a newsletter; and offer free animal education articles and problem-solving assistance to the community. Our fund-raising volunteers research and coordinate new avenues to obtain funds for use in helping animals. Since we do not receive any state or county funding assistance, the fund-raising volunteers are always looking for new sources of revenue. \r\n\r\nFoster homes provide a special environment for our animals to receive the love and attention they so desperately need. Foster home volunteers provide reassuring contact for animals that may have been exposed to cruelty or neglect. They evaluate the needs of each animal and provide valuable information to prospective new owners.

She fell quickly into the matriarchal role in our pack of pups at home.  She was always by your side and happy to follow you around the house wagging her tail.  She was one of the most loyal dogs I ever had the privilege to live with.  She reminded me of my childhood dog, a black lab named Bianca.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2012 I came home to work over lunch to find her being a bit lazy but wagging her tail nonetheless.  In a few short but whirlwind hours she went from acting a bit ill to passing away at the vets office from an apparent unidentified tumor.  At the age of 7 or 8 years old, she left us way too soon!  After trying to settle into life without her in the pack of now 5 pups, we soon realized that her spot in the pack needed to be filled.  There was no doubt that it needed to be filled by another rescue.  After weeks of searching online I found a 4-5 month old puppy who appeared to be about the same breed and looked like an angel!  We started the adoption process and within a few weeks were wrapped up in a world of rescues, shelters and transports.  We made the 10+ hour drive to the shelter where she was being cared for in Bamberg, SC where we met an amazing man named Bob who devotes his time to helping the helpless.  The shelter was a ram shackled place with about 40 dogs who had been abandoned or lost.  Each and every one touched our hearts and we wished we could take them all home.   While we were there to get her we helped to rescue two abandoned puppies from a culvert under the road.  It was then that we knew that we had found our calling!\r\n\r\nUpon her arrival at her furever home\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 she was greeted by the other dogs with lots of sniffs and settled in quickly as the missing member of the pack.  She fit like a glove!  On our first walk that first night she led me by leash to our front yard and made a b-line to the tree where we had too recently buried our precious Vega.  She walked slowly to her gravesite and bowed her head and  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhisper-barked\u00e2\u0080\u009d and walked back toward the house.  As if to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is okay, I will take care of them\u00e2\u0080\u009d!  After spending an hour crying in disbelief, I knew she was exactly what we needed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and we were exactly what she needed!\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on we have been dedicated to do our best to not allow any other of man's best friends to go without all that they deserve!

We are an all-foster network committed to helping dogs and cats in need of homes. Individual donations are our most important source of income as we receive no public funding.\r\n\r\nOur purpose is to provide medical assistance, foster homes, and adoption services to previously lost, abandoned, abused, or neglected animals in Wake County, NC and the surrounding counties. Our mission is to educate this disposable society in which we live that every life should be valued and cherished and is directly linked to human responsibility and commitment.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the animals we rescue require immediate medical attention. BFPA never turns away or euthanizes an animal because of the expense involved in returning them to good health. All our rescued animals are evaluated for temperament, examined by a veterinarian, vaccinated, microchipped (if possible) and sterilized, if age appropriate. Cats and dogs receive monthly flea\/tick preventative and dogs also receive monthly heartworm preventative.\r\n\r\nThe most important ingredients we provide to these animals are loving care and a safe haven -- something most of them have never experienced. These cats and dogs live in volunteer foster homes until we find them a loving permanent home, however long it takes. We match these precious beings to a single, couple or family who understand cats and dogs should be full participating members of the family. Our hope is that these animals never have to experience being unloved again.\r\n\r\nSince our beginning, BFPA has rescued and placed over 2,500 cats and dogs into their forever homes.\r\n\r\nBFPA was created in 1998 by two Raleigh-area women who had volunteered with other established rescues in the Triangle. Their dedication to help homeless dogs and cats has led to an organization that has grown to over 225 volunteers strong.\r\n\r\nBFPA received 501(c)(3) status in 1999.","meetPets":"Because all of our animals are in foster homes (we do not have a shelter or any other official building), animals can be met at our adoption events or scheduled with fosters on an individual basis","services":"fostering, adoption, all animals are fully vetted before being adopted (including spay\/neuter)","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We are a non-profit organization with a 501 (c) (3) designation. \r\n\r\nSave Our Strays became unique in Pinellas County as the only all volunteer organization which, as part of its mission, would accept every stray cat or kitten that needed help IF THERE WAS SPACE IN A FOSTER HOME without prejudice to age, appearance, or health. The cat must reside in Pinellas County. We simply do not have enough foster homes to care for cats from other areas of the state. The only reason an animal within our county would be denied acceptance would be a lack of space. Every animal taken into a Save Our Strays shelter home would be cared for until it was adopted. Euthanasia is not practiced for population control. It is a procedure that is performed ONLY under the advise and supervision of a veterinarian and only if in the best interest of the animal. These animals do not live out their lives in cages. They live in the home of a loving foster parent who cares for that cat for the remainder of its life. Save Our Strays does not accept feral cats into foster homes because we ARE NOT a sanctuary. We do not have the resources, including volunteers and funds, to provide permanent, long term care for feral cats.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there is available space in a shelter home, a cat (non-feral and friendly) is admitted to a foster home. Those seeking our assistance, in most cases, must provide transportation of the cat to the veterinarian for the initial exam or in some cases, directly to the foster home. We do not have volunteers to run pick ups. Prior to adoption the cat is then given a thorough veterinary exam which includes a feline leukemia and FIV test (if old enough), spay\/neuter surgery, a distemper vaccine and a rabies vaccine (if old enough). Every cat is also microchipped. All necessary medical treatment, including surgery, is provided. Once the animal is determined to be healthy, it is ready for adoption and posted on Petfinder and taken to one of several PetSmart stores in Pinellas County various Saturdays throughout the year. Cats are not left at stores.\r\n\r\nSince January 1995, Save Our Strays has medically assisted and adopted out 8500 cats and kittens. This has been possible through the many volunteers who give their time and love to care for these animals and to the generous contributors whose donations go directly to the medical treatment and care of the animals.","meetPets":"Please call us or email an inquiry if you see a cat you would like to meet.\r\nCat Haven\r\nIn Pinellas Park near 49th Street - Available by appointment only.\r\nCall or e-mail to schedule appointment and obtain directions or to volunteer\r\nsos@saveourstraysinc.com\r\n727-481-5262 or 727-545-1116\r\n\r\nPetfinder\r\nTo view some of our cats currently available for adoption, please visit us on Petfinder.\r\n\r\nPetSmart (Countryside)\r\n26277 US Hwy 19 North\r\n(Hwy 19 at Enterprise Road)\r\nClearwater, Florida\r\n727-799-3311\r\nSaturdays\r\n12:00 pm - 4:30 pm\r\n\r\nPetSmart (Gateway)\r\n7777 Dr Martin Luther King St N \r\nSt Petersburg, Florida\r\n727-577-9935\r\nTwice monthly\r\nCall 727-545-1116 for dates\r\n\r\nPetSupermarket\r\nPasadena Shopping Center\r\n6892 Gulfport Boulevard\r\nSouth Pasadena, Florida\r\n727-345-4581\r\nThird Saturday of each month\r\n11:00 am - 3:00 pm","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

For quite some time now, several individuals have been working to make changes for the animals in our county. We care very deeply and are extremely concerned about our community cats and dogs.\r\n \r\nWe are heartsick over the influx of animals coming into our local shelter, resulting in the highest euthanasia rate in our area. The fault does not lie with the shelter, however, but with our very own friends, families, and neighbors. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u008b\r\nWe are devastated by the cats and dogs being abandoned in our community and the countless unaltered animals roaming our streets, propagating an already suffocating animal population. \r\n \r\nSo...we decided to do something about it. \r\n\r\nWe are starting out as a very small group \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but we have BIG dreams. As we gain momentum and support, we aim to focus on the health of our community animals, providing low cost spay and neuter options. We will be providing resources for pet owners in need, enabling them to provide for their cats and dogs in the ways they have always wanted to. We are going to educate the community at large, teaching responsible pet ownership to go along with the resources that will be provided. In sum, we will provide A HOPE for the animals and animal-loving residents of Santa Rosa County. \r\n\r\nPlease open your heart to our cause and join us in whatever capacity you are able. More than ever, our animals need us.","meetPets":"https:\/\/www.ahope4src.com\/adoptions","services":"Adoptions, spay\/neuter, pet food, transport, trapping assistance, rescue support, humane education","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Every home and every companion animal has it 's own unique personality and requirements. We place our animals in the supportive and loving environment of home foster care. While there, we gain knowledge about their personality, training skills, likes and dislikes.\r\n\r\nTo assist us with matching the correct companion animal with the most appropriate and compatible home,please email us the answers to the below questions and any other information you think would be helpful. The emailed information may be followed-up by a Camp Papillon Adoption Coordinator, with a phone interview and then a home check.\r\n\r\nAdoption contract and post adoption follow-up checks are required as a condition of adoption. Some companion animals get multiple applicants or are not appropriate matches, so not all adoptions will be approved. Not all applicants will receive a yes or no response due to limited staff. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur Adoption Costs\r\nDogs: $250\r\nPuppies:$300\r\nPuppies $50 Refund after proof of spay\/neuter\r\nCats: $75\r\nKittens: $100\r\nKittens $25 Refund after proof of spay \/ neuter\r\nRabbits, Ferrets, etc: $25\r\n\r\nWhy the high cost? Can't I adopt an animal for less? No.. and here's why: Our animals come fully vetted. It costs us less for medical care then you due to non-profit discount. So if you adopt an animal for less it will cost you more later. Spay & Neutering your animals, along with keeping up on shots prevents disease & illnesses.\r\n","about":"Camp Papillon is a non-profit, no-kill 501c3 animal rescue group dedicated to giving all homeless animals a place to call home. All of our animals are currently housed in foster homes, we don't have an actual location for housing the animals we rescue. These foster families are made up of dedicated volunteers who open their homes to dogs, cats, rabbits and other animals that are in need of a place to live until they can be adopted.\r\n\r\nThis allows the fosters to evaluate the animals and determine how they interact with people, other dogs, cats, etc. so we can place them in their forever homes. In some cases, the animals are ready for adoption upon entering our rescue. Others need some training or have behavioral issues that need to be addressed before we put them up for adoption. Many shelters would have euthanized dogs that they deem unadoptable, but not us. The foster situation is the best way to be sure these animals are well socialized with people and, most times, with other animals. Camp Papillon covers ALL the costs associated with fostering our animals from vet care to food, toys, treats, etc. Our fosters just supply the love and affection to the animals they take in.\r\n","meetPets":"","services":"adoptions,rescue,shelter,pet food","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

There are no paid staff members with Safe Haven for Animals; the dedicated work is performed solely by volunteers. Funding for our approximately $40,000 annual expenses for rent, utilities, repairs, medical care, food, litter, and other supplies are maintained exclusively by donation of money, time, supplies, independent grants we apply for, garage sale fundraisers (with donated items), and adoption fees ($79-89). The number of animals we can serve is very dependent on our finances. Relief for these expenses come from the very community we serve, and we humbly ask everyone we come in contact with to consider Safe Haven as a cause to get behind.

In the winter months, I felt lost and useless, and bored, so decided that I needed to step up to help rescue as many of the dogs I could, in Rutherford Co, NC where we lived during the winter months. In 2007, we decided to sell our summer place, since Yancey had everything it needed now, with a sweet shelter doing amazing things for the animals in need there. Since, Jan. 2004, H4S has rescued over 7,700 dogs and puppies. We trabsport as many as we can get into other no-kill rescues in NY and NJ, and also adopt out as many as we can handle, each month. We average a population of 35 adoptables each month, as well as 35 permanent 'sanctuary residents', mostly older beagles and hounds. It has become my life's work, and I LOVE what I do.

As a child i constantly picked up strays to re-home. This continued into my adult life. \r\nI rescued my first dog from a fight ring and drug house in 2013. Samson was the first dog i owned in 14 years. He was also the best dog I ever owned. Samson was a mastiff\/shar-pei mix. His brother Memphis came along in a couple of months. In 2016 Samson was poisoned. I spent every day and over 2,000 dollars trying to save him. By the time we figured out what was going on. It was too late. I began to educate myself on dog poisoning and breed selection. Samson never hurt anyone. \r\nThis led me to the world of animal rescues. Though I know i will never have Samson back on earth. If I can save one dog and educate people about breed selection and dog poisoning.

We also do a Google Maps view to ensure it looks like a good area and if they have a fence if required. \r\nIf that passes, the foster will reach out to talk about the animal in question, ask about the applicant's home life and determine if it would be a good match over a few different conversations. If it is a match, the adopter completes a contract and pays the adoption fees (which can includes the transport fees, health certificate fees, and a typical adoption fee). We schedule the animal to either go on transport or to do a meet & greet if it's a local adopter. ","about":"It all began when I rescued my first dog, a Catahoula mix named Dixie, known affectionately by many as \u00e2\u0080\u009cDixie Girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and hence the name of this organization. Dixie was an adult dog who was emaciated, had been hit previously by a car, and had never stepped foot in a house prior to her rescue. She stopped my heart the minute I saw her, and since then, Dixie changed my world forever. She has been my best friend and has shown unconditional love through the thick and thin of every aspect of my life.  I feel that everyone should know the kind of love Dixie and I felt for each other.  Since that day, my passion and empathy for abandoned, forgotten dogs has consumed my life.\r\nFounded in 2018, Dixie Girl Dog Rescue (DGDR) rescues dogs of all ages and breeds.  As articulated in our Mission Statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDixie Girl Dog Rescue is a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding forever families for unwanted, neglected, abused, and homeless dogs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I have always had a heart for the underdogs.  Any rescue organization will jump all over a healthy, cute, young puppy, and while we are here for plenty of them, we are also here for the dogs who need a little extra help, including the mangey, sick, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroken\u00e2\u0080\u009d, broken-hearted, and those who have been abandoned, left behind, and thrown away.  What makes DGDR so unique is its willingness to save any dog from any situation, no matter how bad it may be.  With the help of our committed foster families, we work diligently to place dogs into permanent, loving, and most importantly responsible homes with families dedicated to caring for and making each animal feel like a newer, happier version of themselves. To ensure our rescues find the right families, we require a comprehensive adoption process.  This process includes detailed applications, proper education to prospective adopters, vet checks, references, and thorough client interviews.\r\nDixie Girl Dog Rescue collaborates with other rescue organizations to safely transport and place our rescues into homes mainly in the northern United States.  Dogs in our care receive all proper veterinary care prior to adoption, and, once medically sound, are transported up north fully vaccinated, micro-chipped, and spayed or neutered.  \r\nAll donations received go directly to the care of our rescues. With the right people and right resources, we can make the world of a difference in the rescue world.","meetPets":"We have many animals at our kennels but those are in Birmingham Alabama.

You should receive a confirmation email within two working days that Helping Hands Basset Rescue has received your application. If you do not receive this confirmation from our organization, please complete another online application. Please keep in mind when completing the application to be sure to include your Veterinarians name, address and phone number. As part of our adoption screening process, Helping Hands Basset Rescue will contact your Veterinarian for a reference. We want to ensure that your current and past pets have receive all necessary vaccinations, heartworm preventatives and appropriate medical attention.\r\n \r\nAn adoption coordinator will contact you to discuss what type of basset would work best in your home. We work very hard to match the right dog with the right forever home. A successful adoption depends on both the selection of the right Basset for your household and the understanding of the Basset's caretaking needs. Through our foster homes, we are able to assess each basset for particular traits and dislikes. We may find that certain bassets may not be suitable in a household with children or may not get along well with other pets. We will discuss each basset and their likes and dislikes before placing them in your home.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, Helping Hands Basset Rescue will conduct a \"home visits\" to ensure that your family home is basset friendly and a suitable home for one of our dogs. We ask that when the home visit is conducted, all members of your family are present, including your pets. This visit will enable us to ensure that your home will be a loving, comfortable, and permanent placement for a rescued Basset Hound.\r\n \r\nPlease know that sometimes we can receive up to 10 applications for one dog and we are unable to contact everyone personally with our limited volunteer staff. If you are not contacted by Helping Hands Basset Rescue, feel free to reapply in 30 days. Sometimes the right dog was not available to fit your home when your application was submitted originally. Homes with small children (under 4) are particularly difficult to place a rescued dog in as we can not guarantee temperament.","about":"We are Helping Hands Basset Rescue.

We have a very thorough application which they can fill out and return to the shelter - we do not provide applications on line. We check vet, personal, and landlord references (we require a signed letter from the landlord and confirmation via phone call that pets are allowed). When an application is approved, we set up a meet and greet if there are other animals in the household. If not, the kids are ready to go home. We encourage all potential adopters to spend as much time with the dog(s) as possible before they head home, and an adoption contract is signed before the dog(s) go(es) home.","about":"We are a volunteer-run, no kill shelter running out of a leased 574 sq ft, 8 kennel facility. We average 150 dogs a year through our doors, about 2\/3 of those do not get redeemed to their owners and are placed for adoption. Many of our dogs that come in are in rough shape - some have never seen a vet before, have been used for fighting, breeding, are terribly thin and covered in fleas, etc. Our volunteers pride in caring for these dogs that have been left behind so that they can get into the home that they have always deserved. Before going home, all of our dogs are fixed (unless medically unable to do so - it has happened with seniors and cancer patients), microchipped, vaccinated for rabies, DHLPP, lyme (after testing) and bordatella, and are on heartworm preventative (after testing, of course). Someday we hope to have our own building, with safe, ample space for dogs, cats, and other companion\/equine\/reptilian friends.\r\n\r\nOur volunteer force in 40 strong.

We run on 3 shifts a day, 2 of which are open to the public and one where  someone is there to let the kids out to potty before bedtime. They've been known to pop in at all hours, be it for an 11:30 \"lunch break\" with Pilot (our longest resident of 3.5 years) or at 2am when a nasty thunderstorm is rolling through and the kids are terrified. One of our volunteers has also started an educational outreach program to teach elementary school students about proper pet care, and runs an internship program for the youngest volunteers in our shelter. We're in the process of working out consistent transport for animals in our community to go to a local(ish) low-cost spay\/neuter clinic - it's tricky with large dogs and personal vehicles, so we will see where the ideas take us.\r\n\r\nPersonal note: I (Cheryl) have been volunteering since I was 12 (I'm now 33). I have never met a group of more dedicated individuals. Since we are completely volunteer run, we ask a lot of our volunteers. They put in long hours and do everything for the kids that call our shelter home. They really are an amazing bunch. And they all do what they do because they love the dogs that call our shelter home.

We take special care to match the right home with the right animal, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals.\r\n\r\nStep 1 \u2013 Fill out an Adoption Application\r\nThis application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, training beliefs and background with animals.\r\n\r\nStep 2 \u2013 Application Preliminary Review\r\nOur placement team will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not, you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information.\r\n\r\nStep 3 \u2013 Landlord Approval Verified\r\nIf it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a pet in your home. We will also ask about any breed or size limitations. If your landlord does not allow for a dog or cat in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\n\r\nStep 4 \u2013 Veterinary References Contacted\r\nAn adoption coordinator will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed\/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don\u2019t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped.\r\n\r\nIf your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay\/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be stopped until you can provide this information.\r\n\r\nStep 5 \u2013 Personal References Contacted\r\nAn adoption coordinator will contact your three personal references (only one of whom may be family) and ask them questions in regards to whether they consider you to be a responsible pet owner.\r\n\r\nThis is the portion of the process that can take the most amount of time. It is helpful if you contact your references and ask them to return our calls in a timely manner. If our reference checking volunteers have any major concerns about adopting a dog or cat to you, based on communication with your references, your application may be denied at this point in the process.\r\n\r\nStep 6 \u2013 Home Visit and Applicant Interview\r\nOur organization requires home visits to determine that the pet will be living in a safe environment. This is an informal chance for us to get to know you, your lifestyle, home environment and determine which dog(s) or cat(s) in our program might be the best fit. The home visit volunteer will do a short walk-through of your home and yard to ensure its safety and to advise on any areas of concern. All household members must be present for the home visit.\u00a0 We will also ask for proof of ownership (if you own your home), and will ask for or take pictures of both the interior and exterior of your home.\r\n\r\nIf our home visit volunteers have any major concerns about your home environment, or if you refuse a home visit, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\n\r\nStep 7 \u2013 Meeting between Approved Applicant & Requested or Available Animal\r\nOur organization does not have a shelter where the dogs and cats can be visited. Our animals are in foster homes. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our Fosters until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process.\r\nOnce you have been approved, the adoption coordinator will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s)\/cat(s) you are interested in.\r\n\r\nJust because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog or cat. For some animals we receive many applications so we may allow multiple applicants to have a meeting with the dog or cat before we choose the home that we feel will be the best fit for all. Also, if the volunteer involved in the meeting with you and the animal, does not feel you are a good fit for specific reasons, you may be denied adoption of that particular dog or cat but you may be allowed to adopt another animal deemed more appropriate.\r\n\r\nStep 8 \u2013 Adoption\r\nIf\u00a0 you are approved to adopt you are required to provide payment of the adoption donation fee (and spay\/neuter deposit if necessary). Once received, you become the owner of the dog or cat. If at any time you are having issues with or have questions about your new pet, please call or email your contact person and inform us. A volunteer will be in touch with you ASAP.\r\n\r\nStep 9 \u2013 Notification of Spay\/Neuter & Return of Deposit\r\nIf, at the time of adoption, your dog or cat was not already spayed\/neutered (typically due to being underage or for medical reasons), you would have been required to agree to spay\/neuter your dog or cat, via a spay\/neuter contract, and provide us a deposit fee. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed\/neutered within 1 month of adoption or when age\/medically appropriate. You are asked to notify us when you have scheduled this surgery and at what vet clinic it is being done. Our volunteers will verify that the dog or cat has been spayed\/neutered. Once this has been verified, your deposit check will be returned to you. If you fail to spay\/neuter, as outlined in the adoption contract you signed, our organization will take appropriate measures to take back the animal.\r\n\r\nStep 10 \u2013 Optional Post Adoption Follow-up Visit\r\nOur adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. Looking Glass Animal Rescue is committed to the life, health and well-being of every dog and cat we place for the remainder of that their life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome your new pet, we require by contract that the animal be returned to us. Please notify us ASAP by emailing adopt@LGARinc.org.\r\n\r\nTax-deductible adoption fees can be found on our website at https:\/\/lgarinc.org\/adoption-application\/","about":"Looking Glass Animal Rescue (LGAR\u009d) is a non-profit, volunteer-based animal welfare organization dedicated to rescuing animals from high-kill shelters, hoarding situations, puppy mills, animal fighting rings and more.  While we welcome all animals in need, we specifically focus on animals that are often overlooked due to age, breed, special need or an illness or injury requiring immediate, often costly medical attention that shelters are unable to provide.  Without a rescue outlet, these animals would otherwise be euthanized due to their issues.\r\n\r\nHundreds of animals are euthanized every year due to overpopulation, irresponsibility and sadly, cost.  This is particularly true with animals who suffer medical ailments, many of which are treatable yet they are often deemed \u009c\"unadoptable\"\u009d and withheld from public view.   These animals in particular suffer the worst fate because they sit in pain and fear with no hope of ever being given a second chance at life.  Because of this, we have developed a special focus within our rescue to save as many of these animals as we can.  Veterinary expenses alone can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the severity of the condition, which is often unknown at the time of pull.  Yet, in spite of these costs, our mission for every animal we pull into our rescue is to provide the most advanced medical and pain management treatments possible in an effort to ensure the best possible outcomes for these previously neglected and broken animals.  \r\n  \r\nIn addition to treating their acute medical needs, every animal rescued will be spayed\/neutered, if they are not already, and vaccinated and microchipped as soon as possible in an effort to give them the best opportunity for a healthy, happy life.  When people do decide to foster an animal or adopt from us, they should expect the animal will remain well and not pass disease to their resident pets. \r\n\r\nLastly, for each animal that we place, we provide extensive education on how to transition the animal into their new life.  Basics like crate training, housetraining, obedience training, and the best ways to introduce resident pets are integral for the success of the relationship.  When necessary we will also engage professional trainers for those animals that need specific behavior modification in an effort to help our animals and their new family position themselves for success.  Mental health is as important as physical health and we believe that every animal should be given the chance to lead a life free of fear and anxiety.  Like psychologists, professional trainers are often the only ones equipped to transition an abused animal from the life that once \"was\" to the life that \"could be\".  Our goal is to ensure that all of our animals become a cherished and welcomed member of their new family for the remainder of their lives.\r\n\r\nBy working with a network of volunteer advocates, foster caregivers called Adoption Ambassadors, local veterinarians, trainers and shelters, LGAR is hoping to be able to rescue hundreds of animals every year.  We also serve as a resource to our community by providing information on pet ownership, including resources for spay\/neuter, positive behavior training, nutrition and veterinary care. We believe that no animal should be mistreated and are working toward the day when no companion animal is euthanized for lack of a home.","meetPets":"We are a virtual rescue with our animals located in loving foster homes throughout the Northeast.

Once we have reviewed\/approved your application, we will contact you to arrange a \"Meet & Greet\". Many of our dogs are in private volunteer foster homes. We must schedule a one-on-one \"Meet & Greet\" appointment with each individual dog. It takes time to schedule these appointments, however we do have a standard weekly adoption event at local Petco's, where we show dogs for adoption. We can arrange to have the foster's bring the dog to the Petco. This is the easiest way to set up a \"Meet & Greet\". These adoptions events are usually Saturday or Sunday.\r\n\r\nWhen going to a \"Meet & Greet\", please make sure you take any family members and other dogs to see how the initial introduction goes. That makes the entry into the new home easier for the dog and for you.\r\n\r\nHow it Works:\r\n\r\nIf your \"Meet & Greet\" goes well, you will complete an adoption contract at the appointment and can take the dog home then. We ask for a suggested adoption donation* to help us cover spay\/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies. Then you and your new best friend live happily ever after. It's as simple as that! *Baja Dog Rescue is a 501c(3) non-profit and all donations go directly to the care of our dogs and are 100% tax deductible. The suggested adoption donations only partially cover the cost of the expenses involved in the temporary care and adoption of our dogs.\r\n\r\nWhat if the adoption doesn't work out?\r\n\r\nWe have a lifetime return policy on our dogs as we don't want to see them turned back into a shelter. The application process helps prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions. Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it is imperative that you are forthright in the application process to find the right match. However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult. It can take a good 72 hrs for a dog to really adjust to his\/her new environment. A lot really depends on the dog's past so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.","about":"Our Goal and Mission\r\n\r\nBaja Dog Rescue is a 501c(3) non-profit organization that is run by a group of dedicated volunteers.

We need your help to continue to save the lives of so many wonderful and loving dogs.\r\n\r\nGood-hearted humans can make all the difference!

We have every pug evaluated by a veterinarian and they are spayed\/neutered, heartworm checked, micro-chipped and brought up to date on all vaccinations.\r\nAt this time, due to limited resources, we are only accepting pure bred pugs.

I agree to take full responsibility in meeting all of its needs, including providing appropriate food, exercise, grooming and companionship. I will renew any required licenses annually. My new pet will reside in my home. Under no circumstances will this pet be housed outdoors, in a garage, shed or other building other than that which I live, and I will not give away or relinquish ownership of this pet without prior notification to PAS, Inc.\r\n\r\nI will not allow my pet to roam at large, and will abide by all City and State animal laws pertaining to my pet.\r\n\r\n2. Your new pet has received its vaccinations. Please check with your Veterinarian for regular and necessary veterinary visits and yearly vaccinations to guard against disease. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. will not be responsible for any of these fees.\r\n\r\n3. There is no guarantee that a healthy-appearing pet is not incubating an illness which may become obvious after you take it home. The Parma Animal Shelter suggests that you take your new pet to your Veterinarian. If within 10 days from the date of adoption a serious health problem is discovered, you may make arrangements to return the animal, along with the Veterinarian's documentation of the illness. You may not return the pet due to behavior or minor health problems. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. reserves the right to refuse the return of any animal.\r\n\r\n4. To assist the Parma Animal Shelter in acquiring PERMANENT HOMES for its animals and to prevent \"TRYING OUT\" an animal, the adoption fee is non-refundable. No monetary refunds will be given under any circumstances. Parma Animal Shelter Inc. makes no warranty with respect to the temperament of the pet and will not be held responsible for any damages should the pet act in an aggressive manner.\r\n\r\n5. Any animal adopted into a multiple pet household should be confined from the rest of the pets for at least 7-10 days This will allow time for any communicable illnesses to appear and be treated by your veterinarian without spreading to other pets.\r\n\r\n6. Anyone found in violation of this adoption agreement and who fails to correct the violation within 48 hours, shall forfeit the adopted animal to the Parma Animal Shelter Inc. and be subject to possible fines.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe form above is used for every adoption.\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is $85 for dogs and cats with reduction in price on dogs and cats over 7 yrs old to $50.00.   Puppies under 6 months are $100.\r\n\r\nDOGS\r\n \r\nDogs get: 1 year rabies shot, distemper\/parvo shot, Bordetella vaccine,\r\nHeartworm test and 1st heartworm pill,  they are  also checked for worms.\r\nWe take them to the Vet of our choice for spay\/neuter.\r\n \r\nAdoption Fee for Cats and Kittens \u0096 updated 1\/30\/2013  KITTENS are combo tested and given FVRCP vaccines until 3 months old (3 weeks apart up to a total of 3 shots). A one-year rabies vaccine (and certificate), blacklighting\/lyme dip (for ringworm prevention), two Advantage Multi treatments and four Pyrantel dewormings are administered as well. Spay\/neuter (through a local Veterinarian) is done when the kitten is three pounds. No kitten can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.  CATS are the same as kittens with the exception of a total of two FVRCP vaccines.  No cat can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.\r\n \r\nWe do not adopt animals as gifts or surprises.  The entire household where the animal will live must be interviewed and adoption application submitted for consideration by the Warden and the adoption committee.  If more than one adoption application is submitted for any animal, the decision is based on what is believed to be the best home available -- NOT first come, first serve.  Animals must be held for 5 days to give the owners a chance to find them.  During this time we can accept applications for adoption in case the owner doesn't come in.  We cannot \"hold\" animals till a decision is made whether to submit an application.  If the animal to be adopted is a dog and there is already a second dog in the household, the adoption counselor will want them to bring their other animals in for an interaction at the shelter so their compatibility can be judged.  There are pamphlets available at the shelter and information on this web site that will inform and advise you in the care of the animal you are adopting.  The volunteers are also available to answer questions you may have prior to and following the adoption.  Our mission is to find loving PERMANENT homes for these animals left homeless through no fault of their own.  The experience of being in a shelter is traumatic and distressing when the animals first come in.  We try very hard to make them comfortable during their stay with us.  Please be sure you research your decision to adopt before you apply.  We do not want to traumatize any of our guests further by causing them to be returned after adoption.","about":"The Parma Animal Shelter is run by volunteers for the stray and abandoned animals of the City of Parma, OH.\r\n\r\n6260 State Road\r\nParma, OH 44134\r\ntelephone 440-885-8014\r\nMission\r\nTo reconcile lost pets with their owners and find good homes for stray animals brought in by the Parma Animal Warden.\r\nCompany Overview\r\nThe Parma Animal Shelter is run by volunteers for the stray and abandoned animals of the City of Parma.

Dogs in particular. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until she adopted a Pit Bull puppy, thirteen years ago, that her affinity developed into something much stronger. \r\n\r\nAliceA pharmaceutical sales rep by profession, Lesley spent most of her time off volunteering with dog rescue organizations and animal shelters. She was struck by the harsh reality: The majority of the dogs in shelters were healthy, family friendly animals, but due to time and space limitations, many had just five days to be adopted before being euthanized. \r\n\r\nAn overachiever with a can-do-anything spirit, Lesley knew that she could do more for animals. So she mustered up the courage to leave the corporate world, and created her own dog rescue organization in Los Angeles, Wags and Walks. Her goal is to educate people about the types of dogs in the shelters and find those animals suitable, loving, fosters and adopters.\r\n\r\n392056_2754168612638_225414243_nToday, she visits shelters as far as 60 miles away on a daily basis. She gets to know the animals, takes pictures and video, and urgently networks to find the dogs homes before they run out of time. Lesley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts have been nationally recognized, even resulting in a $10,000 grant from DogTime Media. To date, she has helped save the lives of hundreds of deserving dogs who have brought endless happiness and companionship to their families.\r\n\r\nLesley recognizes that despite her best efforts, many thousands more face uncertain fates. She asks that you join her in committing to saving as many lives as possible. Get involved. Adopt, foster, or donate.

Her goal is to care for sick, undernourished, unwanted animals and to find permanent homes for them. Providing proper care for animals has been an integral part of Heathre's lifestyle. At one point she showed Rottweilers. For many years she was a member of Intermountain Therapy Animals (ITA), an organization dedicated to enhancing quality of life through the human\/animal bond. For the past three years she has been a volunteer at South Utah Valley Animal Shelter, working to reunite owners and lost pets. In May 2014 she organized the annual Celebrate Your Pet Event, a fundraiser for the shelter and great fun for the community.\r\n\r\nEventually Heather became aware of another ongoing animal problem. Not all pets are reunited with their owners, nor should they be. Some animals have been abused or abandoned. There is no going back for them. They have no voice. They need an advocate. Now they have both with Utah Valley Animal Rescue. As Heather says, \"Animals have feelings. They can be hurt. They don't deserve to be mistreated. They trust and depend on their owners. Animals are not meant to be thrown away\".\r\n\r\nUtah Valley Animal Rescue works closely with Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, UT; South Utah Valley Animal Shelter; and area veterinarians to provide a safe place for unwell or traumatized cats and dogs to heal and recover until they can be placed in permanent homes with people who will take proper care of them. All animals are spayed or neutered, and vaccinated before they are adopted out to responsible owners.\r\n\r\nThere are many people working together to ensure that all animals in Utah Valley Animal Rescue's Care are safe and their health is a top priorities. Heather states, We love animals and want to help them.

Simply fill out our Volunteer Application and submit it.\r\n\r\nRead on to find out more about HOW YOU CAN HELP US.\r\n\r\n    FOSTER HOMES - We are currently in desperate need of foster homes as more and more Rotties find their way into shelters. Foster care consists of temporarily housing a Rottweiler while providing for its basic needs such as food, water, shelter. SSRR provides medical care of the Rottweilers in our program, and our foster homes' out of pocket expenses are limited. We prefer that our foster homes keep their foster dogs indoors during their stay. Doing so helps the Rottweiler adjust to the common household noises and smells it will experience in its new home, and it also helps to further determine the personality of the Rottweiler and what type of home situation that it would do best in. We encourage crating the foster dog when not being supervised. Foster families must take a Basic Dog Obedience course within 30 days of becoming a foster family. This will allow the foster dog to have good manners when they go to their \"forever home\"\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    HOME CHECKS - We also need people to do home checks for us. A home visit is something that is required before an individual is allowed to adopt one of our Rottweilers. It consists of going to the home of a potential adopter, checking the dog\u0092s proposed living conditions, asking questions outlined on our home visit form, and basically ensuring that the home is ready and properly equipped to handle the challenges and rewards of adding a new dog to their home. The Home Checks are the eyes and ears of SSRR. Performing the Home Check is what allows SSRR to place dogs in safe and secure homes.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    TRANSPORT - Transport help is of great demand in SSRR. Since we do not limit adopters by making them choose only from the dogs that are in their state of residence, we often need to arrange transport for an adopted Rottweiler to go from one state to another. Our volunteers will fill various 'legs' of the transport as they relay the dog across our coverage area from its current location to its new or adoptive home. Most legs range in size from 50 to 100 miles. Before you take a road trip with your family Check with SSRR to see if you can help transport a dog to their \"Forever Home\"\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    PUBLIC EDUCATION - Since our purpose is not only to save Rottweilers but to educate those around us about this breed, we often reserve booth space at local dog events. We are always in need of volunteers to sit at these booths to pass out promotional material and to talk to passersby about Rottweiler rescue, the importance of spaying and neutering, and Rottweilers in general.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS \u0096 There are other more administrative areas such as fundraising, advertising, secretarial services, correspondence, etc. where we often find ourselves lacking volunteers. If you can be of assistance in any of these areas we welcome you to volunteer to fill this niche.\r\n\r\nAnyone who truly loves this breed can and should be involved in rescue!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt only takes a small portion of your time, and the rewards of doing so measure far beyond compare. If you feel this is the type of organization you'd like to be involved with and you live in one of the states we cover, please fill out our Volunteer Application.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you live in a state outside of our current coverage area, there are many other rescues that will welcome your help.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.rottrescue.org\/national_list_rott_rescue.html\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSSRR is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.

Litters of puppies are often found left in boxes and abandoned in parks, forests, and alongside busy streets. Adult dogs often suffer with untreated diseases and injuries.\r\n\r\nAs a result, some people see the dogs as a nuisance. Street dogs are often the target of a group notoriously called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdog hunters\u00e2\u0080\u009d who poison and shoot dogs in the streets.\r\n\r\nBefore the Euro 2012 games in Kyiv, thousands of dogs were poisoned in an effort to \u00e2\u0080\u009cclean up the streets\u00e2\u0080\u009d before the tourists arrived.  Currently, all dogs left on the street are still at risk of being targeted by exterminators. Without the work of independent volunteers and private shelters, street dogs would have little to no hope for a better life.\r\n\r\nThere are many animal lovers who use their own time, money and resources to rescue injured dogs and abandoned puppies. These are regular citizens who are barely scraping by; dog enclosures have been burned and attacked by dog hunters, and yet they keep working tirelessly to save animals.\r\n\r\nWhy we want to help:\r\n\r\nThere was not much international media coverage about the mass poisoning of dogs in 2012, and even to this day, calls come in on a weekly basis to animal activists from helpless residents reporting poisonings in their neighborhoods. However, these facts are widely unknown.\r\n\r\nTransform a Street Dog formed to bring international attention to this issue and assist overwhelmed animal rescuers. It is difficult to find homes for dogs in Ukraine because of the war in the east and current financial crisis. We created an adoption program to give the dogs and volunteers more hope.\r\n\r\nWhat we do:\r\n\r\n* Sponsor at-risk dogs' stay in safe shelters\r\n* Provide vaccinations and medical care\r\n* Sponsor emergency care for sick puppies and injured dogs\r\n* Recruit volunteers and foster homes to socialize dogs\r\n* Search for homes locally and abroad\r\n* Recruit flight volunteers to transport dogs\r\n* Make all arrangements for legal paperwork and transportation abroad\r\n* Sponsor sterilization surgeries\r\n\r\nOur goals for 2019 are to find homes for 50+ dogs around the world and to sponsor medical care, sterilization surgeries and shelter for many more. For every dog that finds a home, we take another one off the street.\r\n\r\nWe need help from animal lovers like you to save more street dogs from suffering and poisoning.

It is important to note that we do everything first come first serve based on how the applications come in.  So hurry, hurry when getting them back to us! We first complete vet references, and speak with landlords or management companies for approval.  Once that is complete one of our adoption coordinators will reach out to you to do your phone interview. At this time you will be able to ask questions about the dogs and the process and you and our coordinator will decide if this dog would be a good fit for you home. If so there will be a $50.00 deposit requested in order to hold your dog and proceed with the process.  (this fee is part of your adoption fee so when you come on adoption night you just have to bring the remaining $400.00) From there your references will be contacted and your home check will be scheduled. Once that is done the dog is yours and it is just a matter of time until they get here. \u00e2\u0080\u008b\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is a $450.00 adoption fee on all of our dogs. This fee is a reimbursement for all of the services that we have provided to the dog being adopted. We put all of our dogs through a very stringent vetting process, deworm them multiple times, run fecal exams, blood work, heartworm testing, spay & neuter, vaccinate and have them checked multiple times by the vet. Before they are transported, each of our dogs must receive a health certificate clearing them for travel. This fee also helps us cover the cost of transport and any other medical attention the dog may require upon arrival.     \r\n\r\nWe do have a back-up program just in case a dog doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do well in his or her new home.

The breed should be a good fit with your family to ensure a successful adoption.\r\n\r\nPlease be as thorough as possible and put a lot of thought into telling us what kind of qualities and characteristics you are looking for in a pet. Our goal is to match our pets to the perfect family for them. Pets may need different things from a home in order to be successful and happy.\r\n\r\nAfter we receive and review your application, we will be in touch with you to tell you if your application was approved. If it is approved, the foster family of the pet you are interested in will contact you to discuss your application, answer any questions that you have and arrange a home visit.\r\n\r\nEveryone who lives in your household should be there for the home visit. The foster parent will bring the pet to your home to meet your family and your current pets (if any), see how everyone interacts, and make sure you have a safe environment for the pet. Because they know the animal well, they will let you know if this pet is the right fit for your family.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes have multiple applicants for the same animal. Please remember that it is not \u00e2\u0080\u009cfirst come, first served,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rather it is the best fit for the animal. We take the responsibility of choosing the best home for our foster pets seriously.\r\n\r\nIf your family is approved to adopt you will have a two week \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrial\u00e2\u0080\u009d period, in which the pet will live with your family. When the pet begins their trial period, you will sign a contract with the foster parent and pay the adoption fee. If at the end of the two week trial, you and the foster parent agree that the pet is a good fit for you, and you for the pet, then the adoption is finalized.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason during the trial period it is determined that the pet is not a good fit for you, or you for it, the foster parent will pick up the pet and your adoption fee will be refunded. Our goal is to find the perfect fit for you, as well as for all animals in our care.\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee includes all current shots, microchipping, and a spay or neuter. We are also here to answer any questions you may have post adoption.","about":"Animal Allies of Texas is a 501(c)(3) animal advocacy\/rescue organization, dedicated to improving the quality of life in our community.

The\r\nhorrific case of an abused dog brought this group to life. His name is Champ, a Mastiff-mix who was\r\nfound chained to a tree, severely emaciated, and near-death in Laurens County, SC. Our members,\r\nfrom across the US and around the world, have come together to fight for Champ and all abused\r\nanimals.\r\nA new non-profit, however, our group has been operating for a little over a year, with a\r\nsteady 4,600 member following. As a group, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done some exciting things in our short existence.\r\nA few of our highlights include; a highly successful email campaign to have charges in the case of\r\nChamp, upgraded to a felony against his abuser, a demonstration outside the Laurens County\r\nCourthouse. Fight Like A Champ was immensely involved in South Carolina Senate bill S.105, The\r\nAnimal Welfare Bill with Humane Society of the United States on Humane Lobby Day at the\r\nStatehouse in Columbia, SC. We work tirelessly, attending any county council meetings we can get\r\non the agenda for. Our group was utilized to help pass tethering ordinances in both Spartanburg and\r\nGreenville counties.\r\n In addition to running our own rescue and advocacy work, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve helped numerous private\r\ncitizens obtain spay\/neuter services through our friends at SPEAK FOR ANIMALS. We LOVE to\r\nhelp our friends in the rescue community in any way we can. Whether it's through fostering for them,\r\nhelping them out with a food donation, or helping raise funds for specific special needs animals. We\r\nlike to help those who help others. By working together we can help more, do more , be more\r\neffective advocates for the animals we represent.\r\nWe \u00e2\u0080\u009cliberated\u00e2\u0080\u009d a Husky who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d spent the entirety of his four years chained to a tree in Lyman,\r\nSC. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to report he's been successfully vetted including neuter and is being adopted by\r\nhis foster family. We specialize in orphaned bottle puppies, but have a strong passion for pit bulls\r\nand black dogs too. All medical care is provided for all rescue dogs including but not limited to,\r\nspay\/neuter, vaccines, microchipping, flea and heartworm preventative. We currently have\r\nseventeen dogs in the custody of our rescue.\r\nWe have big plans for the future as well. With our 501c3, we will have the ability to do so\r\nmuch more for the community. The establishment of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpop-up pet food bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099, is one of our dreams.\r\nWe believe that helping people in need with what seems so small to us, can actually help keep a pet\r\nin a home and out of a shelter. Through our \u00e2\u0080\u009cpop-up pet food bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099, we plan to distribute\r\neducational and information handouts containing information on other available community services\r\nfor pet owners, spay and neuter info, vaccination and vet info, and how to report animal abuse.\r\nIn our wildest dreams, a building where we would house more animals pulled from \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh kill\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nshelters and enough funds to feed and vet them while they search for forever homes. \r\nThank you for your interest in our passion for saving lives.
